		<p><em>(reading time: 9 minutes)</em></p>
<p>Starting in <a href="https://blog.ncase.me/the-most-meaningful-books-i-read-in-2016/">2016</a>, then <a href="https://blog.ncase.me/the-most-meaningful-books-i-read-in-2017/">2017</a>, then <a href="https://blog.ncase.me/the-most-meaningful-books-i-read-in-2018/">2018</a>, I've continued my yearly ritual of sharing <strong>the most personally meaningful books I read that year</strong>. Which books broke my heart and re-built it stronger? Which books were the keystone puzzle pieces in my mental jigsaw? Which books gave me the swords and shields to survive in our strange new world?</p>
<p>Well this year I finally got sick of books.</p>
<p>So, here's my Most Meaningful <em>Media</em> of 2019 – this includes books, but also films, comics, academic papers, web-interactives, etc.</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<hr>
<h2>📜 Most Meaningful Story</h2>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/Exhalation_Ted_Chiang.0.jpg" alt="Exhalation_Ted_Chiang.0"></p>
<p>Ted Chiang's sci-fi always hits a sweet spot of hard science and humanist feeling, because he knows what few others do: <strong>science <em>is</em> human.</strong> Technology <em>is</em> humanity's dreams and delusions, made real.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101947883">Exhalation (2019)</a></strong> is his newest anthology of short sci-fi stories. It begins with a story of deterministic time travel, as a person struggles to accept an unchangeable tragic past. Then there's a story of AI pet enthusiasts, as they struggle to raise their &quot;children&quot; in a brave new world. And it ends with a story of multiverse communication, as people suffer anxiety over what their alternate selves coulda-woulda-shoulda done.</p>
<p>I said that this year I got &quot;sick of books&quot;. That's because so many novels are stuffed with fluff to meet their contract's 200-300 page mark. Not with Chiang. Each short story hits its ideas and feelings at lightning pace. Result: you spend half an hour reading one story, then half a day <em>really</em> thinking about it.</p>
<p>Speaking of writing good stories...</p>
<h2>🤔 Most Meaningful Non-Fiction</h2>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/ab1313642e2f1287af29551afcf749d2.jpg" alt="ab1313642e2f1287af29551afcf749d2"></p>
<p>&quot;Peter's uncle died and Peter fights crime.&quot; – that's not a story.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter's uncle died <em>because</em> of Peter's irresponsibility, <em>therefore</em> Peter uses his great power with great responsibility, and fights crime.&quot; – that's a story so well-known, it's practically Mythology.</p>
<p>There might never be a Grand Unified Theory of Storytelling, but <strong>Robert McKee's <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780060391683">Story (1997)</a></strong> comes close:</p>
<p><strong>Story = Value + Cause</strong></p>
<p>Value is emotional. Cause is logical. What I love about this equation is that it shows how great stories are both – they make us feel <em>and</em> think. (see: Chiang's humanist sci-fi)</p>
<p>That's why every human culture tells stories, even though they could use that time for improving one's survival: because stories <em>do</em> improve our survival. A simplified fiction guides us through the chaos of life, just as a simplified street map guides us through the chaos of a city.</p>
<p>Great stories show us what Causes what we Value.</p>
<p>(As for me, I used McKee's framework to design my interactive story, <a href="https://ncase.me/anxiety/">Adventures With Anxiety</a>)</p>
<p>I said so many novels these days are fluff'd, but I find that most modern non-fiction is too. Especially pop science. This year, I skipped the books, and went straight to the source – the scientific papers themselves:</p>
<h2>📄 Most Meaningful Paper(s)</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1?needAccess=true&amp;">Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work (PDF)</a></strong> showed me that my career of making educational games was... kinda based on a lie. But this paper introduced me to powerful new ideas like Cognitive Load Theory + the Expertise Reversal Effect, and ultimately, this hard-to-swallow pill will make my educational games much better.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ippanetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Martela-Steger-JOPP.pdf">The Three Meanings of Meaning In Life (PDF)</a></strong> made my existential-anxiety episodes more useful. Previously, when I felt &quot;meaninglessness&quot;, I'd get stuck in a loop because &quot;meaning&quot; is a fluffy word. This positive-psychology paper helped break &quot;meaning&quot; down into 3 parts: cognitive, affective, and motivational. (This explains why great stories, which make you feel <em>and</em> think, are such powerful sources of meaning!)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167200266002">Daily Well-Being: The Role of Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness (PDF)</a></strong> showed me Values &amp; Causes in real life. The study shows how just <strong>3 psychological human needs</strong> – being true to yourself (Autonomy), being with others (Relatedness), and doing good work (Competence) – predict better mental health, and even better <em>physical</em> health! Inspired by this paper, I kept a journal of how much my needs were fulfilled/frustrated each day... and how I could do better tomorrow.</p>
<p>Speaking of mental health...</p>
<h2>🎥 Most Meaningful Film</h2>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/Joaquin-Phoenix-The-Joker-2019.jpg" alt="Joaquin-Phoenix-The-Joker-2019"></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(2019_film)">Joker (2019)</a></strong> left me feeling like a worse <em>and</em> better person.</p>
<p>Great stories can also show us what Causes <em>the opposite</em> of what we Value – what turns people into monsters. You crush an at-risk person's 3 psychological human needs, and well... they may stop being psychologically human.</p>
<p>I already <a href="https://twitter.com/ncasenmare/status/1182462956191338498">tweet-stormed</a> my review of it, so I'll just repeat it here:</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/joker.png" alt="joker"></p>
<p>What's more, <em>Joker</em> is the only film I've seen so far that takes violence <em>seriously.</em> For contrast: I just saw the new Star Wars flick, where Kylo Ren kills more people in his first scene than Arthur Fleck does in his <em>whole movie.</em></p>
<p>In <em>Joker</em>, the violence was almost <strong>anti</strong>-cinematic. No sanitized cut-aways, no pornographic close-ups, no soundtrack or sexy editing. I don't think any of the deaths even happen in the <em>middle</em> of the frame – as if the cameraperson just happened to be there.</p>
<p><em>Joker</em> shows violence as it is. It's not a bringer of glory, nor a sexy taboo act.</p>
<p>It's just ugly.</p>
<p>Though, that's not to say I don't enjoy the occasional sexy violence...</p>
<h2>🖼 Most Meaningful Comix</h2>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/91flVg9E48L.jpg" alt="91flVg9E48L"></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781927668689">When I Arrived At The Castle (2019)</a></strong> by Emily Carroll.</p>
<p>&quot;Lesbian gothic horror furry vampire romance.&quot;</p>
<p>That's all I have to say about that.</p>
<p>Anyway, speaking of non sequitur segues...</p>
<h2>💻 Most Meaningful Web Interactive</h2>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-30-at-7.05.14-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2019-12-30-at-7.05.14-PM"></p>
<p>You know how you read a great book, learn all kinds of insights... then a month later you've forgotten everything? (Another reason I'm now &quot;sick of books&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">Quantum Computing for the Very Curious (2019)</a></strong> by Michael Nielsen and Andy Matuschak solves that problem. Not only is it an accessible-yet-deep intro to quantum computing – you don't need prior knowledge of quantum mechanics <em>or</em> computing! – it also has one core new innovation:</p>
<p>In-built Spaced Repetition, or, &quot;flashcards on steroids&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVajQPuRmk8">Spaced Repetition</a> feels like cheating. By just investing a few minutes – strategically spaced out over months – you can choose to commit anything you like to long-term memory!</p>
<p>Example: I read QCVC Chapter 1 in March, and nine months later I <em>still</em> remember what a Hadamard gate is, its exact matrix representation, and famous quantum circuits that use it. In contrast: in March I saw a bunch of talks at a conference and now I don't even remember <em>which</em> talks I saw.</p>
<p>Combined with the many other cognitive science papers I read this year (like the one which ruined/re-built my edu-games career), I think QCVC hints at how to Cause something I deeply Value – a bright new future of education:</p>
<p>One that actually <em>works.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Stuff From Years Past That Still Influence Me A Lot</h2>
<p>Each year, I share media that felt super meaningful to me at the time... but as the years pass, I realize what a gullible idiot infant child I was, and only 5% of the stuff I said was life-changing actually ended up changing my life.</p>
<p>But, I guess that's Time's job: to filter out the truly great stuff. So, here's things from years past that are <em>still</em> meaningful to me, even after all this time.</p>
