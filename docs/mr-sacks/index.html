<p><em>What part of “ezam a ni eud emit revo dna” don't you understand?</em></p>
<p>Bloody hell, none of my so-called &quot;peers&quot; get it. The subject we've been interviewing – one Mr. Sacks institutionalized at Massachusetts General Hospital Psychiatry – was not speaking some hitherto unknown language to humanity. It's simply English, in reverse: “and over time due in a maze”. English words, but no grammar. Textbook case of aphasia, possible lesion in the Broca's area.</p>
<p>They interrupted my coffee break for this?</p>
<p>I explained my conclusion very, very slowly to my &quot;colleagues&quot;, should they have any lesions in <em>their</em> prefrontal cortices. Bugger, I was late for my lecture. I rushed out the doors, ran through traffic, thinking about how even if I was late the ungrateful undergraduates should kiss my feet for even giving the time of my very busy day, thinking about how I'm good enough dammit, thinking so much I did not notice the BMW rushing through the red light about to hit me, which it did, then I stopped thinking at all.</p>
<hr>
<p>I awoke two months later.</p>
<p>I sat up, and was hit with a headache that made me wish I hadn't put off signing that Do Not Resuscitate form.</p>
<p>A nurse – couldn't make top grades, huh? – noticed my awakening, and called for an actual doctor, although I'm better than most of these quacks. After taking her sweet time, the doctor finally entered my room and said:</p>
<p>“##############.”</p>
<p>...What the hell?</p>
<p>I tried to ask them if they knew who I goddam was, but all that came out of my mouth was:</p>
<p>“#####? #####?! ###############!”</p>
<p>The nurse and doctor looked at each other, then at me, as if <em>I</em> was the one who's gone barmy. Worse, after double-checking my vitals, they transferred me – of all places! – to the Psychiatry ward. And as if Lady Luck wasn't done with me quite yet, the first patient I met there was none other than my former case study, Mr. Sacks. He sat next to me at the in-patient dining room table, a green banana in hand, and said:</p>
<p>“Hah, got you too, eh friend?”</p>
<hr>
<p>This psychiatry ward is <em>nothing</em> compared to the academic career ladder. I climbed my way up that, I could climb my way out of this.</p>
<p>I'm good enough, dammit.</p>
<p>First, I bribed a med school intern (one who still recognized me) to bring me my phone and charger. Of course, I couldn't just ask him in language – I was temporarily incapacitated in that regard – so I slowly pantomimed my request to him as if he was a slow child.</p>
<p>Plan A was to use a speech-to-text app to figure out what the staff were saying. No such luck. I wasn't even able to <em>read</em> the text on my phone's UI – it was all reversed and scrambled, like my initial messages from Mr. Sacks. Who, this whole time, was being unhelpful, saying things like:</p>
<p>“Why the rush to leave, friend? Relax, stay a while.”</p>
<p>But he would be useful soon enough. Clearly, I'd discovered a new neurological phenomenon with only two known cases in the world: him, and me. They'd name it after me, of course. Once I got out of here, I could use him to propel myself to the top of the ladder, to international glory, and show everyone who never believed in me. My God, they may even name a <em>university</em> after me!</p>
<p>“You're not trapped in a maze, pal. You're <em>exploring</em> a maze.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Plan B: I wait. Eventually one of my idiot colleagues will come and get me out. Also, I was using this downtime to secretly record my conversations with Mr. Sacks – who gives a toss about some measly HIPPA regulation – so I could analyze his condition later. For now, if I can't understand the others, and they can't understand me, at least I can try to understand this man. I'm good enough, dammit.</p>
<p>“Good buddy, it's all in due time.”</p>
<p>He was <em>still</em> holding that damn banana.</p>
<hr>
<p>A week went by.</p>
<p>Nobody, not one of my colleagues, came by to visit me.</p>
<p>Were they doing this as some kind of sick revenge? After everything I'd done for them? At this point, I didn't even want them to get me out, I just wanted...</p>
<p>...Well, no matter. I had made a breakthrough with Mr. Sacks' condition. Interestingly, although I <em>heard</em> him in clear English, when I ran his conversations through speech-to-text, it came out reversed and scrambled, the same way as before. By having both his literal words &amp; translated meaning, I could deduce this pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>He says something like “ezam a ni eud emit revo dna”</li>
<li>Reversed, that reads “and over time due in a maze”</li>
<li>Break that into three-word fragments, and you get &quot;and over time&quot;, &quot;in due time&quot; (reversed), and &quot;in a maze&quot;.</li>
<li>Each of these three-word fragments are connected by their first or last words.</li>
<li>One can plot these fragments as a graph. If you do, <em>a perfect structure is revealed:</em> his words are a winding path through a lattice grid – a grid where each corner is a word, each line is a fragment. What's more, that grid has dimensions N x 3, which looks like this: ###################</li>
</ul>
<p>At first I thought Mr. Sacks was just another unpromising case study, but now I understood his logic. Besides, he was the only one I could talk to. None of those ingrate bastards ever visited me. Was I not good enough? After everything I did to please them – all the sleep-deprived nights of studying, all the friendships I sacrificed, all the people I pushed aside to get here – was I still not enough?</p>
<p>Funny: I ran the staffs' dialogue and mine through speech-to-text, and analyzed their structure. Most of their paths were straight lines. Mine was a loop.</p>
<p>I told Mr. Sacks all this. Not because I <em>like</em> him or anything, it's just that he can't tell anyone else. In my world, that's as close as you can get to &quot;trust&quot;. After I told him all this, he said nothing. Then, he offered me that banana. The one he'd been holding for a whole week. By then it had gone from green to a brownish, almost-too-ripe. I took it, and ate it. Then Mr. Sacks said to me:</p>
<p>“You are enough.”</p>
<p>There must have been something wrong with that banana, because I began choking up and my eyes started watering.</p>
<hr>
<p>It's been five years.</p>
<p>Mr. Sacks and I do get the occasional visitor now. About three years ago a researcher, Henrietta Molaison, found us and deciphered our language structure. She used to be one of my undergrads.</p>
<p>I'm happy for her, I really am.</p>
<p>Since then, we've had researchers from around the world come to visit us, stick us in fMRI machines, use supercomputers to decode our language, the whole works. It's strange – though I still can't understand people's words, I feel like I understand people <em>better</em> than when all I had were words. When I talk with others, I see: are they a line? A loop? A branching tree? A wandering path? Or a single, unmoving dot?</p>
<p>Mr. Sacks and I are happy. A year ago, the supercomputers were briefly unable to decode our language. They got it functioning again once they realized our structure had evolved: our thought-paths had started intertwining into a braid.</p>
<p>Occasionally I understand short English questions. One we get a lot is: don't we feel trapped? We say, no, we're not trapped.</p>
<p>We're exploring.</p>
