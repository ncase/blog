		<p>Ten months ago, I had the idea to do <em>some</em> interactive thing involving Hebb's Rule &amp; neurons. Since then, I've been sketching/prototyping several different versions. The final version I released, <em><a href="http://ncase.me/neurons">Neurotic Neurons</a></em>, took only four weeks from start to finish, and that's including one week off for XOXO.</p>
<p>So, that's nine months of mucking about, then one month of actually useful work. The 90% crap rule holds up.</p>
<p>Anyway, the upside of having created and playtested so many different versions, is that I can compare and contrast them. With the feedback of dozens of playtesters, I now have semi-sorta-kinda-not-really-empirical evidence of what does and doesn't work for an interactive explanation.</p>
<p>Here's what works. This is kind of a note to self, so next time, I can avoid nine months of mucking about.</p>
<h3>1. Huge possibility space.</h3>
<p>Before <em>Neurotic Neurons</em>, my neurons project looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/09/ahhh.gif" alt="GIF - iltbam anxiety"></p>
<p>It definitely had more story and art, but there were only there things you could actually interact with. As my playtesters reported, it didn't feel like a <em>system</em>, it felt like an obtuse animation.</p>
<p><em>Neurotic Neurons</em> took the complete opposite approach:</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-27-at-14-00-02.png" alt="click neuron"></p>
<p>When it starts off, you get 30-ish neurons you can click in any order you want, whenever you want, even while the narrator is talking. Even in the therapy scene:</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-27-at-14-02-53.png" alt="therapy"></p>
<p>There's still nine neurons you can click in any order you want. What I <em>could</em> have done was force the player to go through each set of three in sequence, but limiting it down to three options would feel like -- as reported before -- an obtuse animation. Ironically, most players solved the therapy puzzle sequentially from left-to-right <em>anyway</em>.</p>
<p>There's another major difference <em>Neurotic Neurons</em> took from my previous version...</p>
<h3>2. Direct manipulation.</h3>
<p>As you saw in the first GIF above, you'd click the book, <em>then</em> my character reads it, <em>then</em> some magic signal flies off, <em>then</em> it fires the neuron. That's three in-betweens.</p>
<p>In Neurotic Neurons, you click to fire a neuron. Not even <em>one</em> in-between. The manipulation is <em>direct</em>.</p>
<p>There's not much to say about the virtues of direct manipulation, other than it gives better control, or at least a better <em>illusion</em> of control, and besides, it just <em>feels</em> good, which brings me to my next point...</p>
<h3>3. Juice! Juice! Juice!</h3>
<p>When you first click on a neuron, it just sends <em>so many</em> signals out flying, creating lots of interesting visuals from one or a few interactions. That's what game designers call <em>juicy</em> -- things that squish &amp; squash &amp; bounce &amp; brighten &amp; react to whatever you do.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/09/propagation.gif" alt="GIF - clicky propagation"></p>
<p>Feels good, man.</p>
<p>(In an early prototype of <em>Neurons</em>, the neural network was randomly generated, meaning some neurons would have no outbound connections, so they were boring to click. So that's why in the released iteration, I manually created a neural network so that <em>any</em> neuron you'd click on your first go would be juicy and interesting.)</p>
<p>On top of the <em>visual</em> juice, one unique aspect of Neurons was the <em>voice</em> juice.</p>
<p>I, the narrator, would react to little things you do, too! (Inspired by <em>The Stanley Parable</em> and <em>Bastion</em>, of course.) If you made little mistakes in the Hebb/Anti-Hebb parts, my narrator would gently guide you. The first time you click a neuron, I say <em>‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù</em> If you click a neuron before I was done talking in the intro, I'd say <em>‚ÄúEx-CUSE me, I'm talking here!‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Why would I let the player interrupt me? Other than being funny, it fits other design pattern I stumbled upon...</p>
<h3>4. Low non-interaction.</h3>
<p>With the exception of the 8-second intro and 8-second outro, you can <em>always</em> interact with something in Neurotic Neurons. Even during the credits. Even while the narrator is talking.</p>
<p>(For some reason, most of my players decide to patiently wait for me to finish talking, and I'm not sure why. Maybe just the <em>knowledge</em> you could interact if you wanted to is enough.)</p>
<p>This &quot;Always Be Interactive&quot; rule has already made its way to mainstream game design, with games that deliver story through scripted sequences, or disembodied voiceovers. (as opposed to the game-story design philosophy of mixing cutscenes and gameplay, like oil and water.)</p>
<p>However, not <em>all</em> kinds of interaction are good, so...</p>
<h3>5. No crap-interaction.</h3>
<p>Think back again to the first GIF I showed you, where you have to click to get a piece of the story about my anxieties, and there's no meaningful choice of what to click. That's a crap interaction.</p>
<p>(<strong>Aside:</strong> There's two exceptions I can think of for when &quot;click-this-to-progress&quot; can work: creating anticipation, like unwrapping a present, or creating panic, like a series of fast quicktime events.)</p>
<p>(<strong>Aside II - The Tangentioning:</strong> I'll write more about crap-interaction in a future post, but Bret Victor's long-ass essay, <a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/">Magic Ink</a>, has a particularly eye-opening section titled ‚ÄúInteraction Considered Harmful‚Äù. If you have, uh, an hour to spare, I recommend reading it.)</p>
<p>But interaction for the sake of interaction? No. So in my new version, when I deliver the part of my story about my anxieties, the neurons <em>automatically</em> fire. You <em>can</em> still interact with it if you want to, but you no longer <em>have</em> to:</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/09/fears.gif" alt="GIF - fears"></p>
<p>Oh, this scene reminds me. You see that specific arrangement of neurons? I considered other arrangements, but this one was the only one that let me...</p>
<h3>6. Keep mechanics consistent.</h3>
<p>For comparison, I previously wanted to make the fears <em>hierarchical</em>, like a fear of public speaking connecting to both a fear of social interaction and a fear of failure. However, if the player were to disconnect <em>those</em> connections, the entire thing would make no sense. The only way to prevent that would be to &quot;lock&quot; the connections.</p>
<p>An ugly solution which, actually, in a previous version, I did implement:</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-27-at-13-49-09.png" alt="pavlov lock"></p>
<p>It's a sucky solution, so I scrapped my plans for a hierarchical arrangement, and did the three-part arrangement you see in the final version.</p>
<p>However, <em>that</em> arrangement still needed constraints. You shouldn't be able to connect fears to each other, or connect feeling fear to feeling safe. However, this time, I could enforce that constraint through <em>spatial distance</em>! Those neurons would simply be too far apart for Hebb's Rule to work, something I already established <em>before</em>.</p>
<p>The lesson I learnt was, whenever you need to enforce a constraint, <em>try to use the mechanics you already have</em>.</p>
<p>Also, one should try to be consistent with the mechanics throughout. In the introduction to Neurons, I could have disabled Hebb &amp; Anti-Hebb's rule, just to focus on the signal propagation, but I thought it'd feel more elegant to have it consistent throughout.</p>
<p>And besides, in a previous version, I <em>did</em> toggle the rules on-and-off at different points, but that just made it more confusing, <em>less</em> clear, which brings me to my final lesson...</p>
<h3>7. Clarity &gt; Cleverness.</h3>
<p>Early on, I made a whole bunch of things I thought was just <em>sooooo</em> clever, but just ended up making things more confusing. Here's a few of 'em:</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-27-at-13-57-47.png" alt="Hebb's Rule"></p>
<p>Hebb's Rule has a nice mnemonic rhyme, ‚ÄúNeurons that fire together, wire together.‚Äù However, that rhyme doesn't tell you <em>which</em> direction the connection is created. Anti-Hebb's rhyme, ‚ÄúNeurons that fire out of sync, lose their link,‚Äù also just confused people.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-27-at-13-51-32.png" alt="pavlov's pug"></p>
<p>One original premise for my neurons project was to explain the famous conditioning experiments, and see them in a new light! However, since they wouldn't be in ‚Äúa new light‚Äù if you <em>didn't</em> know about them, and if you <em>already</em> knew about them, the puzzles would be boringly easy... so it was all just cleverness for no solid reason.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-27-at-13-56-15.png" alt="chompy"></p>
<p>Finally, there's this clever thing, the thing I was most reluctant to kill. Chompy the Lizard Brain. So cute! So loveable! Ended up being a very muddled metaphor that confused everyone, including myself.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note: more clarity =/= more exposition.</strong> In previous versions, I'd over-explain things, but the more redundant information, the less players paid attention, so the <em>more</em> confused they were later on.)</p>
<p>By the way, as much as I dislike listicles -- such as this blog post -- I will admit it's a very clear format.</p>
<h3>In Summary:</h3>
