<h2>üê¶ Trans furry hyperpop conlang musical mockumentary</h2>
<p>Previously, I signal-boosted the constructed language (conlang) <a href="https://blog.ncase.me/signal-boosts-aug-2024/#toki-pona">toki pona</a>, and the trans furry hyperpop musician <a href="https://blog.ncase.me/signal-boosts-aug-2024/#moretransfurryhyperpop">Ida Deers</a>.</p>
<p>This month, a fan emailed me to tell me an artist who combines <em>both</em>: <strong><a href="https://www.zewei.xyz/">ZeWei</a></strong>. (ok I guess their music's more IDM than hyperpop, but w/e)</p>
<p>Recently, ZeWei created a mockumentary for a &quot;cursed conlang&quot; contest. Imagine <em>Arrival (2016)</em> but furry. It's a short film about a linguist who gets stuck in an alien world full of cyborg-trees, whose language a) has 600 pronouns, b) the phonemes are microtonal music, and c) the formality system is <em>so</em> intense, that the social authority of who you're talking to modifies not just Subject-Verb-Object order, but even order of <em>sentences and paragraphs</em>. And that's just <em>three</em> of the many messed-up features of this constructed language!</p>
<p>And then at the end, as a total flex, ZeWei performs <em>an entire song</em> in this language.</p>
<p>22 minute video, very worth the watch:</p>

<p>This artist also has a Bandcamp! <a href="https://zewei.bandcamp.com/album/flickering">Here's an older album from them</a>, with accompanying YouTube release:</p>

<h2>üëã Dynamicland is back, bay-beeeee</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://dynamicland.org/">THEY'RE BACK!</a></strong></p>
<p>(after being closed for the pandemic &amp; a bunch of internal restructuring)</p>
<p>What is Dynamicland? Well first, <em>why</em> is Dynamicland? Right now, the overall trend in computing is to be isolating, take away user agency, and limit ourselves to our thumbs. Dynamicland wants to reverse all those trends. Dynamicland is a lab, a proof-of-concept, of computing that's social, where everyone can be a creator, and you use your full bodies to interact with it.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamicland is <em>a whole building that is a computer interface.</em></strong></p>
<p>(Here's a 7-minute intro:)</p>
<iframe width="640" height="360"  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5Q9r-AEzRMA?rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><em>Right now</em>, Dynamicland accomplishes this by having cameras that track objects, and projectors to put displays on them. It's like mixed reality except it doesn't require that everyone buy their own $3,000+ headset. However, I need to emphasize: <em>this cameras-and-projectors system is NOT the point of Dynamicland,</em> it's just the closest that can be accomplished with today's tech. (Maybe in the far future we'll have fully programmable matter?) As the saying goes: <em>&quot;Look where I'm pointing at, not at the tip of my finger.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Two personal notes:</p>
<p>1) The founder of Dynamicland, Bret Victor, greatly inspired me, is a good mentor, and invited me to the first Explorable Explanations workshop, which basically single-handed created my whole career over the past decade. So, this is a note of gratitude! (and/or disclosure of conflict-of-interest)</p>
<p>2) A few years ago, at Dynamicland, I made a game called FROG WARS played with origami frogs. The goal was to hop your (physical) frogs towards (virtual) flies, while also bumping your opponents' (physical) frogs out of the arena.</p>
<p>It was the best game I ever made and I'll never live up to it again.</p>
<p><img src="../content/stuff/2024-10/frogwars.gif" alt="GIF of my Dynamicland game &quot;FROG WARS&quot; in action"></p>
<p><a id="toaster"></a></p>
<h2>üçû &quot;I put a toaster in the dishwasher&quot;</h2>
<p><img src="../content/stuff/2024-10/toaster.png" alt="Before &amp; after photos of putting a toaster in a dishwasher; it's much cleaner, and still works!"></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://jdstillwater.blogspot.com/2012/05/i-put-toaster-in-dishwasher.html">A lil' anecdote from JD Stillwater</a>.</strong> Common sense says no of <em>course</em> you shouldn't put a toaster in a dishwasher ‚Äî and a <em>lot</em> of sarcastic, over-confident internet comments back that up.</p>
<p>But, if you actually think about the physics step-by-step, an electrical short happens when there's an unintended path for electricity to travel (e.g. through water), which can cause damage. So, if you were to put an unplugged toaster in a dishwasher, <em>then let it dry for several days</em>, there would be no leftover water in it (toasters are <em>designed</em> to avoid trapping moisture), and thus, no risk of an electrical short.</p>
<p>But that's all theory. Toasters are cheap. So, JD Stillwater just <em>tried it</em>, and,</p>
<p>yup, it worked!</p>
<p>Signal boosting this because it's a great short (real-life) story, that shows the conflict between <em>seeming</em> scientific &amp; rational, and <em>actually being</em> scientific &amp; rational. Similar vibes to <a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm">Feynman's famous Cargo Cult Science talk</a>.</p>
<p>(Hat tip to Slime Mold Time Mold <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2024/08/30/links-for-august-2024/">for helping me discover this essay</a>, and kudos to Nehaveigur <a href="https://nehaveigur.com/2024/09/05/i-put-my-toaster-in-the-dishwasher/">for successfully replicating this experiment!</a>)</p>
<p>(That said, I'm still too cowardly to <em>actually</em> try putting a toaster in a dishwasher. If <em>you</em> want to try replicating this experiment, then: 1) <em>Please let it dry for several days before plugging it back in.</em> 2) Just in case, get a large fire extinguisher graded for electrical fires (you should have a fire extinguisher anyway), and 3) Neither I nor the authors of the above links are responsible if you die, lol.)</p>
<p><a id="hats"></a></p>
<h2>üß¢ &quot;I wish I could wear hats&quot;</h2>
<p>Last month, a friend introduced me to the works of Brian David Gilbert, and...</p>
<p>... look, I can't explain BDG. I can only beseech you to look &amp; listen to this 98-second video:</p>
<iframe width="640" height="360"  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bmFGbBmlyKQ?rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><em>Right?!</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Heh, that's a charming silly idea. Oh. Oh okay it's body dysmorphia and possibly gender dysphoria. Oh okay that hat at the end is wearing a hat. Oh.&quot;</em></p>
<p>But don't worry, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfw9n2ktX9k">not all his songs are metaphors</a>. One time he just published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wpHszfnJns">a half-hour-long video explaining healthcare terminology</a>. It was actually upsettingly useful; I made like 20+ Anki flashcards off that video.</p>
<p><a id="hs"></a></p>
<h2>üåï &quot;H.S&quot;</h2>
<p>Just a vague cherry-picked hypothesis, but I've noticed at least two (&amp; a half) major &quot;vibe eras&quot; in Western comedy during my lifetime:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 90's &amp; 00's were the peak of edgy transgressive humor, like (early) South Park, (early) Family Guy, Dane Cook, etc.</li>
<li>Perhaps, as a reaction to the hollowness of &quot;being edgy for edgy's sake&quot;, recent decades had more self-deprecating, introspective humor, like: Bo Burnham, Bojack Horseman, and the comics of Shen Comix, Sarah's Scribbles, and Hyperbole &amp; a Half. (Even South Park has become more reflective &amp; character/story-driven.)</li>
<li>And now, perhaps as a reaction to how much of a downer <em>that</em> vibe is ‚Äî especially &quot;post&quot;-pandemic ‚Äî comedy might now be shifting towards a &quot;WE ARE SO BACK&quot; vibe?</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example of that last vibe shift, consider Australian comedy musician Tom Cardy. His early work was all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbmP2c6TGKc">very self-deprecating</a>, but in recent years it's shifted more towards a defiantly upbeat style.</p>
<p>For example, this, a recent song &amp; music video (animated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LankyMF">LankyMF</a>), <strong>&quot;H.S.&quot;</strong>:</p>
<iframe width="640" height="360"  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kK0KPuH32mc?rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This song &amp; music video genuinely makes me feel <em>so</em> emotional. I've listened to it several times on loop, it's a great comfort pump-yourself-back-up song. And huge props to LankyMF for the delicious character designs, and the music video's story!</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://tomcardy.bandcamp.com/album/the-dancefloor-at-the-end-of-the-universe">You can get Tom Cardy's latest album here!</a></strong> And watch the other music videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW7AGm8JSBEEew61dJIgl_A">on his YouTube</a>.</p>

<h2>üê∫ A 3D-printable claw</h2>
<p>Being an adult means you can put minimal effort into a Halloween costume because it's &quot;sexy&quot;. Anyway here I am:</p>

<li>They are surprisingly sharp, and can leave marks that last a <em>week</em>.</li>
<li>They have improved my quality of my... relationships.</li>
</ol>

<p>If anybody asks you why you're printing them, tell 'em it's for Halloween.</p>
<p>If it's past Halloween by the time you're printing them, tell 'em it's for next Halloween.</p>

<h2>üëü Slip-on Shoes</h2>
<p>I hate tying shoelaces.</p>
<p>Let's crunch the numbers, shall we?</p>
<ul>
<li>1 minute <em>at best</em> to tie-on and take-off shoes each day</li>
<li>That's ~365 minutes lost a year, or ~6 hours.</li>
<li>If I value my time at $30/hour, that's $180 lost a year. You can definitely buy slip-on shoes for less than $180.</li>
</ul>
<p>But wait, let's go further:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's conservatively estimate that ~50% of adults globally wear shoes with shoelaces. (The rest wear slip-on sandals, no shoes, etc.)</li>
<li>There are ~6,000,000,000 adults worldwide. So, 50% of that, ~3,000,000,000 adults lose 6 hours every year. Or: 18,000,000,000 person-hours lost per year.</li>
<li>Since there's 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, ~80 years per lifetime, that's... ~25,000 person-lifetimes a year, lost to tying shoelaces.</li>
<li>For comparison: In the US, ~25,000 people are murdered annually. The 9/11 attacks killed ~3,000 people.</li>
<li>Therefore: Shoelaces are equivalent to American murder, or eight 9/11's a year.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Obviously tone-indicator sarcastic</em>, but the point still stands:</p>
<p>I HATE TYING SHOELACES</p>
<p><strong>Anyway, I got some slip-on shoes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TBT3KBX">from KEEZMZ on Amazon</a>.</strong> I originally wanted Velcro but I suggested this to a friend and he said &quot;yeah if you wanna look like a kid?&quot; so I guess I got adult-shamed into buying slip-on:</p>
