		<p><em>(reading time: 35 minutes ‚Äì a bit over one TV episode)</em><br>
<em>(content note: queer &amp; mental health stuff, the &quot;heavy shit&quot;)</em></p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/banner.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I don't know where the line is between &quot;publicly taking responsibility for my past mistakes&quot; and &quot;masochistic exhibitionism&quot;, but it's the end of a decade ‚Äì a good time to reflect, and share stories I've <em>never</em> shared publicly before!</p>
<p><strong>In 2010‚Äì2019, I learnt a lot about being queer, going indie, and mental health.</strong> Life lessons found through trial-and-error-and-error-and-error.</p>
<p>So, what wonderful things did I learn this decade?</p>
<h2>2010: The Year I Learnt I Was An Asshole</h2>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/2010-1.jpg" alt="2010-1"></p>
<p><em>(&quot;Nicklaus Liow&quot;, circa 2010, who was an asshole)</em></p>
<p>I made my lab partner do all the work for our Science Fair project, which won a city-wide contest, and I claimed the credit. But when it lost the province-wide contest, I blamed the <em>fool</em> for dragging down my <em>genius</em>.</p>
<p>Whenever I lost a game, I'd accuse others of cheating. Whenever I got a test question wrong, I'd blame the ambiguous wording. Every other recess, I'd corner a religious classmate and quote paragraphs from <em>The God Delusion</em> at them.</p>
<p>Also I had a creepy obsession with knives. üî™</p>
<p>It's a clich√© story. Lonely angry kid, raised by a hyper-competitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_parenting">tiger mom</a>, thinks: &quot;I want to not be lonely ‚Üí I must make others respect me ‚Üí I must make myself look powerful &amp; others look weak.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2010, I learnt the scientific term for this style of cognition is called &quot;being an asshole&quot;.</p>
<p>The realization took years. In 2006, we immigrated from Singapore to Vancouver. After four years of hanging out with other classmates, I learnt that their healthy friendships and families were based on, y'know, <em>actual respect</em>. Not the pile of narcissism, guilt-tripping, and psychological manipulation that I grew up thinking was normal.</p>
<p>A healthy relationship with another human being. I wanted that bad.</p>
<p>I wanted that so, so bad.</p>
<p>Thus, I finally acquired a &quot;voice of conscience&quot;. It said:</p>
<p>&quot;I want to not be lonely ‚Üí <strong>I must become a good person</strong> ‚Üí I must help others and make the world a better place.&quot;</p>
<p>Why not? It was 2010, a new decade, a new start. I was 16 years old and I knew everything.</p>
<p>What's the worst that could happen?</p>
<h2>2011: The Year of Coming Out</h2>
<p>I wanted to be a good person. A good person is honest. So, I came out to my mom as bisexual. She sent me to a child psychologist to convince me I was &quot;just confused&quot;.</p>
<p>I felt like <em>I</em> was the asshole. My voice of conscience told me: <em>She's a poor immigrant AND a single mom AND had an abusive ex-husband AND was raised by a narcissist mother... and now we're threatening her dreams of having grand-children?!</em></p>
<p>So, Mom &amp; I went to the child psychologist. We all talked for a bit, then the shrink requested to speak to me alone. Mom left. I felt like I fucked up so badly. The shrink turned to me, and said with the most serious look:</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry, I get homophobic parents all the time. You're okay, Nick.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm... okay?</p>
<p>No-one's said that to me before. I may not be a &quot;good person&quot;, but at least I was an &quot;okay person&quot;. I felt so grateful to the psychologist, and I told him that. I also felt sexually attracted to him because he was the only warm father figure in my life, but I did not tell him that.</p>
<p>A few months later, a trilogy of <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/467574">ultraviolent</a> <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/522607">meme-filled</a> <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/569281">Flash games</a> I made ‚Äì under the online handle &quot;NutcaseNightmare&quot; ‚Äì caught the eye of a developer at Electronic Arts. They offered me a student co-op internship in the Bay Area!</p>
<p>Heck yeah I'd sell my soul, I wasn't using it anyway.</p>
<p>I took the offer, mostly to get out of my family &amp; to a more queer-friendly space. EA gets a lot of (justified) flak, but the Human Rights Commission ranks them as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/26/7293809/electronic-arts-lgbt-best-companies">one of the most LGBTQ-friendly companies</a>. I'm still deeply grateful to my EA colleagues &amp; mentors who helped me during my coming out.</p>
<p>Which reminds me of one moment:</p>
<p>The CEO was giving the annual company talk, when he presented one of EA's employees: a trans woman.</p>
<p>This was the first time I (knowingly) saw a trans woman. Remember, this was 2011 ‚Äì before the world knew Laverne Cox, Caitlyn Jenner, or the Wachowski <em>Sisters</em>. Probably the only trans character most people had seen was the villain from Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.</p>
<p>The woman spoke on how her coworkers helped her through her transition. I was selfishly relieved ‚Äì if they accepted her while she was on 5-to-6 layers of queer, then I, &quot;NutcaseNightmare&quot;, would be too.</p>
<p>I'm okay.</p>
<p>(The CEO followed this by supporting the internet-censoring Stop Online Piracy Act. You win some, you lose some.)</p>
<h2>2012: The Year of Dropping Out</h2>
<p>I got sick of working for <em>THE MAN‚Ñ¢.</em> So after my internship, I dropped out of college to rebel against <em>THE SYSTEM‚Ñ¢.</em> I teamed up with a pal to found a &quot;startup&quot; that would ‚Äì since my voice of conscience demanded I be a good person ‚Äì <em>MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE‚Ñ¢</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/2012.png" alt="2012"></p>
<p><em>(&quot;Nick Liow&quot;, from a 2012 fundraising video for our bullcrap startup. Note how fundamentally uncomfortable I am in my own body.)</em></p>
<p>Apparently, it's stressful to run a fake startup while being technically still a teenager. In 2012, I had my first panic attack in public, and tried drowning my anxiety disorder in random hookups with men old enough to signal &quot;daddy issues&quot;.</p>
<p>(hot tip: if you ever go to an orgy at a venture capitalist's house, they'll be amused if you call it a seed round)</p>
<p>One time, I had unprotected sex in a gay bathhouse. After he came inside me, he mentioned, oh by the way he has HIV. I got tested. Negative. But I had to get tested again in 3 months to be sure. I was in a daze all season, listening to <em><a href="https://frontalot.bandcamp.com/track/diseases-of-yore">Diseases of Yore</a></em> on loop, thinking, &quot;Oh God, I've killed myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Tested again. Negative again. The biggest fucking sigh of relief.</p>
<p>(HIV isn't the death sentence it used to be, but god damn.)</p>
<p>If reality had Proper Storytelling Technique, this <em>should</em> have the wake-up call to collaborate with my &quot;negative&quot; emotions in a healthy way, rather than drown them in dick-based distractions.</p>
<p>It was not. I learnt nothing. (Okay, I learnt to practice safer sex and get an STI checkup every six months. Not a total loss.)</p>
<p>Anyway, our startup failed! Nobody cares. Here's a more fun year in my life:</p>
<h2>2013: The Year I Filled A Sink With Blood</h2>
<p>I was back in the Bay Area. I was renting a bunk-bed, in a room with 4 people, in a shared house with 10 people. Housing sucks in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Remember my &quot;creepy obsession with knives üî™&quot;? That's right, it wasn't a throwaway one-liner, it was a Chekov's Gun foreshadow! Proper Storytelling Technique!</p>
<p>For my birthday, I bought myself a hunting knife. For reasons I can't comprehend, I wanted to look at it in a Safeway supermarket. But I didn't want to scare others around me, so I tried opening the knife in the dark of my backpack, and sliced my thumb open.</p>
<p>Well, I didn't want to bother anyone ‚Äì a <em>good person</em> puts others' feelings before their own! ‚Äì so I grabbed some paper towels, wrapped my thumb, and snuck out of the Safeway while the intercom blared &quot;code 211&quot;. I assume that meant &quot;cleanup&quot;.</p>
<p>I took the hour-long Caltrain ride home, and tried rinsing my thumb in the bathroom sink. Strangely, blood just <em>kept coming.</em></p>
<p>After half an hour(?), the manager of the shared house knocked on the door, and asked if I was okay. Apparently, he was concerned about the blood drops leading to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I said I was okay, but, um, maybe needed a little bit of help if that's not too much of a bother, I don't want to be a <em>bother.</em> I unlocked the door, and he came in.</p>
<p>A bunch of blood + a lot of water + a clogged sink = not a pretty sight.</p>
<p>He drove my dumb ass to the hospital, while I went full Canadian and said &quot;sorry&quot; 500 times. This was my first run-in with American healthcare ‚Äì without insurance ‚Äì so, oof, let's say I'm glad I saved money by dropping out of college.</p>
<p>But here's what shocked me the most: <em>nobody was mad at me.</em></p>
<p>I was the kind of person who was so terrified of being a burden on others, I'd rather bleed out than <em>bother</em> anyone. That's when I finally learnt:</p>
<p><em>It's okay to ask for help.</em></p>
<p>Asking for help doesn't make me a bother, or a bad person, or a narcissistic asshole. And to internalize this lesson, all I had to do was to almost lose a digit to bacterial infection! üëç</p>
<h2>2014: The Year I Peaked</h2>
<p>I started the year convinced <em>I</em> was a bacterial infection.</p>
<p>I was back to making indie games, but my voice of conscience was screaming louder than ever:</p>
<p><em>You're still not a good person! Help others! Make the world a better place!! All we do is make opiates for the masses in the form of &quot;satire&quot; videogames, with the intellectual sophistication of a newspaper political cartoon!!!</em></p>
<p>In February 2014, my crowdfunding campaign ‚Äì for <a href="https://nothing-to-hide-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">a satire videogame about mass surveillance</a> ‚Äì was failing. I needed a promo, quick.</p>
<p>I narrowed it down to two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An interactive tutorial on how I did the 2D lighting effect in my game, or,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A My Little Pony parody. That marketing strategy worked for the indie game <em>Fighting Is Magic</em>, right? Bronies eat this stuff up!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sadly, I couldn't do Option #2 in time, so I settled for #1.</p>
<p>I made <strong><a href="https://ncase.me/sight-and-light/">Sight &amp; Light</a></strong> ‚Äì my first-ever &quot;explorable explanation&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/snl.png" alt="snl"></p>
<p><em>Sight &amp; Light</em> got <em>way</em> more popular than the game it was promoting. It was even seen by Bret Victor ‚Äì former Apple designer, now working on a lab where <a href="https://dynamicland.org/">&quot;the entire building <em>is</em> the computer&quot;</a> ‚Äì who invited me to a workshop for people who make experimental media...</p>
<p>...which was where I met Vi Hart ‚Äì math YouTuber, VR/AI researcher, cool snail-person ‚Äì and together we made <strong><a href="https://ncase.me/polygons/">Parable of the Polygons!</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/polygons.png" alt="polygons"></p>
<p><em>Polygons</em> was a simulation of how small biases can segregate the world. It got 3 million plays. Remember, 2014 was the year of #GamerGate and Ferguson, so, &quot;it was timely&quot;.</p>
<p>(I also started my Patreon around this time, for side-income)</p>
<p>What about the game I crowdfunded, and was <em>supposed</em> to be working on?</p>
<p>It sucked.</p>
<p>Many things sucked about it, but especially the writing. I had no Proper Storytelling Technique! So, I decided to deliberately practice my storytelling skills, by writing 1 short story every other day on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/">r/WritingPrompts</a> for a month.</p>
<p>But I still needed to practice storytelling for <em>games</em>. So, during a 3-week game jam, I made <strong><a href="https://ncase.itch.io/coming-out-simulator-2014">Coming Out Simulator</a></strong>, a &quot;half-true story about half-truths&quot;. It was an interactive story about the time, in 2011, when I came out to my family as bisexual.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/cos2014.png" alt="cos2014"></p>
<p>(&quot;Half-true&quot; ‚Äì I left out the part where my mom sent me to a child psychologist, because I thought it wouldn't be believable. I shifted the year from 2011 to 2010 so I could make <em>Inception</em> jokes. I added back my mom's abusive ex-husband to make her more sympathizable ‚Äì Proper Storytelling Technique dictates that all you need for a sympathizable character is a tragic backstory, right?)</p>
<p>Turning my painful memory into a game was cathartic. The game reached a million folks, including lots of queer teens, who needed some hope in hard times.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Sight &amp; Light, Parable of the Polygons, Coming Out Simulator ‚Äì all side projects I made to distract myself from my failing <em>main</em> project ‚Äì are still some of the most personally meaningful things I've ever done.</p>
<p>Best of all, it got my voice of conscience to shut up! (For a few months.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile...</p>
<p>In 2014, in a different shared house, my housemates wanted to pull a prank, which somehow involved someone crossdressing as a woman. I was the only volunteer.</p>
<p>My friend lent me her dress, bra, and wig. She helped me put on makeup. I distinctly remember looking in a mirror...</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/2014-1.jpg" alt="2014-1"></p>
<p>...and wondered why, for the first time in my life, I actually felt <em>comfortable</em> in my own body.</p>
<p>But deeper questions about myself would have to wait for another day. For now, it was imperative I post the photo on Facebook with an ethnic joke:</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/2014-2.png" alt="2014-2"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, my online handle &quot;NutcaseNightmare&quot; was too long for Twitter, so I shortened it to &quot;@ncasenmare&quot;. Then, shortening it further, I bought the domain name &quot;<a href="http://ncase.me">ncase.me</a>&quot;. Finally, I realized I hated having the last name of a father who was never there, so I retconned my own name to fit my website ‚Äì I changed &quot;Nick Liow&quot; to &quot;Nick Case&quot;.</p>
<p>No... that didn't sound quite right.</p>
<p>&quot;Nick_y_ Case.&quot;</p>
<p>That sounded... good.</p>
<h2>2015: The Year of My ‚≠êÔ∏è MAGNUM OPUS ‚≠êÔ∏è</h2>
<p>Okay, fine, I was &quot;non-binary&quot;.</p>
<p>I don't know the bio-psycho-sociological reason I feel this way. Maybe <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19359705.2013.753393">prenatal factors</a> or whatever. But I do know when I look &amp; sound androgynous, I feel, <em>&quot;this body actually belongs to me.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Strangely, coming out as non-binary was much easier than coming out as bi. I guess it's because: 1) I was in a more LGBTQ+ supportive environment, and 2) I wasn't adamant on what pronouns people used for me. I mean, I didn't want to be a <em>bother</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/2015.jpg" alt="2015"></p>
<p><em>(Nicky Case, 2015, who was not a bother)</em></p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>My voice of conscience was satisfied that in 2014, I made meaningful projects that helped others. So in 2015, my inner voice congratulated me:</p>
<p><em>MAKE MORE, YOU LAZY DINGUS</em></p>
<p>It elaborated:</p>
<p><em>Sure, Parable of the Polygons had a pro-diversity message, but we're just preaching to the SJW choir! And Coming Out Simulator never gave any actual advice on HOW or IF to come out! We just made #relatable content to capitalize on gay eyeballs!</em></p>
<p><em>We're still the narcissistic asshole we were before 2010! Help others! Be a good person!</em></p>
<p>So in 2015, I set forth on my <strong>‚≠êÔ∏è MAGNUM OPUS ‚≠êÔ∏è</strong>: a game mixing my personal journey with hard science, that would help others by blah blah blah it was an overscoped, bloated piece of crap that never launched.</p>
<p>(During this time, I didn't have a 9-to-5 job, and my Patreon wasn't enough to sustain me. I took on random freelance gigs while burning through my savings. Also, I cancelled the satire videogame I crowdfunded, and gave everyone a 75% partial refund.)</p>
<p>While failing to &quot;help others&quot; in my professional life, I also tried to &quot;help others&quot; in my personal life:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I dated two people with mental disorders for the purpose of &quot;saving them.&quot; Unsurprisingly, that was condescending &amp; shitty. (I'll make no excuses: I was the asshole here.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had a &quot;fan&quot; emailing me every day, threatening to kill himself if I didn't keep responding to his emails within 24 hours. I was a stranger's one-person suicide hotline for six months. (Spoiler: he wasn't suicidal, it was just good ol' psyschological manipulation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried reconnecting with my mom. I hoped she changed her views on homosexuality ‚Äì and she did! She denied having <em>ever</em> been homophobic, she's always been the <em>best</em> supporter of gay rights, and boasts to the other parents about how open-minded she is to have raised such a brave child.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Why did I try so hard to change others?</p>
<p>In hindsight, I know the exact answer: I needed to believe that, with enough kindness, <em>anyone</em> can change for the better. Why? Because I needed to believe that <em>I</em> could change for the better.</p>
<p>...that I could become a good person.</p>
<p>I didn't want to be just another narcissist raised by a narcissist (who was herself raised by a narcissist). If it wasn't for my supportive friends, or the sexy child psychologist, or the internship that got me away from home... who knows, maybe I'd have shot up my school.</p>
<p>I don't mean that flippantly. In 2015, I started suffering from violent intrusive thoughts. My most common intrusive thoughts included: cutting off my fingers with garden shears, opening someone's skull with a rock, burning a person alive.</p>
<p>I told no-one about this.</p>
<p>This is a subtype of OCD called <strong><a href="https://www.intrusivethoughts.org/ocd-symptoms/harm-ocd/">Harm OCD</a></strong>. Of course, I didn't know that at the time ‚Äì let alone how common it is, how it doesn't predict actual violence, or how ‚Äú85%(!) of the non-OCD population admits to having unwanted violent thoughts.‚Äù</p>
<p>You know how &quot;don't think of an elephant&quot; makes you think of an elephant? That's how Harm OCD works. Your voice of conscience says &quot;don't think of something evil&quot;, your imagination comes up with something evil, your conscience freaks out, uses that as further proof you're a monster, lather rinse repeat.</p>
<p>That's how my conscience worked. It reminded me: <em>you remember the Virginia Tech school shooter? He was ALSO a lonely Asian immigrant kid with a history of severe anxiety and creating ultraviolent media! That could have been YOU! That's why I need to keep you in check:</em></p>
<p><em>If not, you'll become a monster.</em></p>
<p>And so, 2015 ended and I was still not a good person. But at least I started self-studying <strong><a href="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a> (CBT)</strong>, which helped me realize that anxiety was irrational. CBT says anxiety/depression is caused by &quot;cognitive distortions&quot;, like jumping to conclusions, should/should-not statements, the just-world fallacy, etc.</p>
<p>Learning about CBT gave me hope: maybe I could fix myself! The decade was only half-over.</p>
<p>I could still learn how to be good person.</p>
<h2>2016: The Year I Almost Committed A Murder</h2>
<p>&quot;Before you rent a room in the house I'm living in, you should know I was convicted in my 50s for having sex with a 15-year-old.&quot;</p>
<p>He didn't say it with quite so much narrative exposition, but close enough. I'd just moved to Boston for a journalism fellowship, and this was who I found on Craigslist.</p>
<p>You know where this is going. I was more afraid of being selfish than being safe: that's why I let myself bleed out into a sink rather than <em>bother</em> anyone. My voice of conscience demanded I give this 70-year-old a chance:</p>
<p><em>He already served his time. Aren't we believers in restorative justice? In forgiveness, grace, redemption, compassion, empathy? That anyone can change for the better? If we reject him we're preventing ex-cons from re-integrating into society!! We're promoting mass incarceration!!!</em></p>
<p>Besides, he told me about how <em>he</em> was molested as a kid. Proper Storytelling Technique dictates that all you need for a sympathizable character is a tragic backstory.</p>
<p>So, I sympathized, and agreed to live with him.</p>
<p>Did I get anxiety about it? Of course! But now I knew anxiety was just irrational &quot;cognitive distortions&quot;. So now, my voice of conscience could override it with reason:</p>
<p>The old man kept putting his arm around me? <em>Just a guy trying to be friendly!</em></p>
<p>He tells me about nearby parks where people used to have gay sex? <em>Just an old man rambling about the good ol' days!</em></p>
<p>It turns out ‚Äì after searching his name online ‚Äì it wasn't a one-time fling with a 15-year-old, but two prolonged years with three 13-to-14-year-olds? And he only served 5 years? <em>Hey, we all embellish the truth sometimes!</em></p>
<p>My colleagues saved me. They noticed I was coming into the newsroom each day sleep-deprived, as if I'd spent each night carefully watching the lock on my bedroom door for two weeks.</p>
<p>They helped me get out, and one of them kindly let me crash on her couch while I found a new room. (The new room had bedbugs. An improvement, really.)</p>
<p>Around this point, I wondered if maybe ‚Äì <em>just maybe</em> ‚Äì my voice of conscience <em>was</em> my anxiety.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>A few months passed.</p>
<p>Summer 2016 was hectic for journalists. Brexit won. 49 people were killed in a gay nightclub. Hillary &amp; Trump were campaigning. 85 people were killed on a beach in France. A gorilla was shot.</p>
<p>One hot summer day, I thought again about that creep. I was angry that I let myself be manipulated, that he got away with it, and that he probably found some other vulnerable intern to prey on.</p>
<p>But ‚Äì I thought as I looked around the newsroom ‚Äì that's just how the world is. Horrible shit happens, nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>I thought some more.</p>
<p>Actually, it's pretty obvious what I could do about it. I went to the kitchen, got a serrated steak knife, and started walking to the creep's address which was just 20 minutes away.</p>
<p>My anxiety of conscience flipped out. <em>NICKY THIS IS EVIL.</em></p>
<p>You're the reason this happened in the first place. Why should I listen to you now? You're just an irrational voice who's tortured me my whole life.</p>
<p><em>Okay he was awful but he shouldn't DIE for it!</em></p>
<p>Cognitive distortion: &quot;Should Not&quot; Statement. Morality is just a hegemonic social construct.</p>
<p><em>If you kill him they'll put you in jail for life!</em></p>
<p>Cognitive distortion: Jumping to Conclusions. 40% of murders go unsolved. And I've a better chance of getting away with it, because the police won't look closely into a murdered kiddy fiddler.</p>
<p><em>They'll suspect one of his past victims, and you'll get them arrested!</em></p>
<p>Cognitive distortion: Just-World Fallacy. Too fucking bad for them.</p>
<p>I got to the creep's house. The neighborhood was empty because everyone was away at work ‚Äì except for him, who I knew worked at home. Alone.</p>
<p>I hovered my finger over the doorbell, and gave my inner voice one last chance to talk me out of it.</p>
<p><em>Th... the knife isn't sharp enough?</em></p>
<p>I looked at my steak knife. Oh, right. I worked in <em>journalism</em>. We can't afford fancy cutlery. This isn't a steak knife, it's a <em>bread</em> knife. A blunt, dinky <em>bread</em> knife.</p>
<p>I felt too embarrassed to murder a guy, so I went back to the office, ate lunch, and told nobody about it until December 2019, when I started writing this blog post.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Why the heck did I just tell you this?</p>
<p>All but one of my friends strongly advised I do <em>NOT</em> share this story, lest I get &quot;cancelled&quot;. Yet, that just made me want to share it <em>more!</em></p>
<p>After much thinking about my thinking, I think here's my 3 main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nobody was hurt or even <em>knew</em> about it, thank god.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A story where an inner voice convinces a mentally ill person to <em>not</em> commit a murder? What a delicious subversion of a standard horror trope! Proper Storytelling Technique!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I want to de-stigmatize talking about violent urges.</strong> The <em>years</em> I suffered from intrusive thoughts, I felt like I couldn't tell <em>anybody</em> ‚Äì not my closest friends, not a therapist, and definitely not the whole internet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A parallel: in the last decade, we've made tremendous progress on de-stigmatizing talking about suicide ‚Äì so that folks suffering from suicidal thoughts can get help to <em>not</em> act on them.</p>
<p>Likewise, we should de-stigmatize talking about violent urges ‚Äì so that folks suffering from violent thoughts can get help to <em>not</em> act on them, either.</p>
<p>Survivors of abuse/neglect aren't just more prone to suicidal ideation ‚Äì we're more prone to homicidal ideation, too. But &quot;you can't talk about it&quot;. Therefore, you don't learn how common (and treatable!) it actually is. So you bottle it up until you implode on yourself, or explode onto others.</p>
<p>And then a newsroom like mine reports &quot;oh what a horrible tragedy no-one could have seen coming&quot;. Lather rinse repeat.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>To be clear: <em>I made a deeply immoral mistake.</em> I don't endorse my actions, but I take responsibility for them. Still, I learnt two valuable life lessons:</p>
<p>One ‚Äì Self-studying a therapy <em>may</em> have limitations.</p>
<p>Two ‚Äì <strong>&quot;Your feelings are always valid&quot; and &quot;Negative emotions are irrational&quot; are both harmful bullshit.</strong> What anxiety says can be right, wrong, or a mix of both. My journalist colleagues gave me a useful quote for dealing with emotions:</p>
<p>&quot;Trust, but verify.&quot; (thanks, Reagan)</p>
<p>I didn't know <em>how</em> to balance trusting/verifying my anxiety, but it and I reached a ceasefire. I wouldn't try to drown it out with risky sex or cognitive-distortion-finding ‚Äì and in return, my anxiety promised:</p>
<p><em>Okay, I'm sorry. I won't try to motivate you to be a better person by comparing you to school shooters. Like the 2014 Isla Vista shooter, who was also a lonely, mentally-ill immigrant who hated his Asian heritage. I also *won't* say the only reason we're not an &quot;involuntary celibate&quot; spree-killer is because we're queer and therefore have easy access to HIV-infected dick.</em></p>
<p>Thanks, anxiety.</p>
<p>It also stopped demanding I make my <strong>‚≠êÔ∏è MAGNUM OPUS ‚≠êÔ∏è</strong> ‚Äì now, I could do smaller experimental projects!</p>
<p>In October 2016, I made <strong><a href="https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb">We Become What We Behold</a></strong>, a 5-minute story-game about hate, violence, and news cycles. (A lot of my frustrations of working in journalism went into this)</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/wbwwb.png" alt="wbwwb"></p>
<p>In November 2016 someone got elected.</p>
<p>In December 2016, I made <strong><a href="https://ncase.me/ballot/">To Build A Better Ballot</a></strong>, an interactive guide to alternative voting systems.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/ballot.png" alt="ballot"></p>
<p>Then...</p>
<h2>2017: The Year I Peaked, Again</h2>
<p>In March 2017, I made <strong><a href="https://ncase.me/loopy/">LOOPY</a></strong>, a tool for making simulations of systems by <em>drawing</em> them.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/loopy.png" alt="loopy"></p>
<p>In May 2017, I made <strong><a href="https://ncase.me/fireflies/">Fireflies</a></strong>, a simulation of fireflies.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/fireflies.png" alt="fireflies"></p>
<p>And then... my <em>lucky break:</em></p>
<p>In July 2017, I made <strong><a href="https://ncase.me/trust/">The Evolution of Trust</a></strong>, an interactive guide to the game theory of trust ‚Äì and how to build it (or destroy it) in the world.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/trust.png" alt="trust"></p>
<p>I still don't get why <em>this</em> was the piece that made my career ‚Äì maybe because 2017 seemed like a zero-trust dumpster fire ‚Äì but it got 5 million plays, and doubled my Patreon income.</p>
<p>Specifically, my Patreon now paid <em>my food and rent.</em></p>
<p>Goodbye random freelance gigs! Goodbye bouncing from internship to internship! After 7 years, I was now... üåà <strong>FULL-TIME INDIE‚Ñ¢</strong> üåà</p>
<p>(But seriously, I'm super grateful to the 1000+ of y'all who have supported me via Patreon over the past few years. üíñ You're buying me my sustenance and shelter, not to mention creative freedom. Thank you, deeply. I hope my story about almost killing a guy didn't freak you out too much.)</p>
<p>In hindsight, The Evolution of Trust also answered my biggest moral problem:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;How do you be a good person <em>without</em> being taken advantage of?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>As you've seen, my maladaptive version of &quot;forgive &amp; forget&quot; + &quot;put others before yourself&quot; led to several shitty situations.</p>
<p>Game theory has a better solution: in The Evolution of Trust, little simulated characters play a game of trust with each other, where they can either &quot;cheat&quot; or &quot;cooperate&quot;.</p>
<p>If they only play the game once, the winning strategy is &quot;Always Cheat&quot;. But if they play the game <em>repeatedly,</em> the winning strategy becomes &quot;Copycat&quot;: cooperate in the first round, then <em>do whatever the other player did in the previous round.</em> Do unto others!</p>
<p>But if mistakes can happen ‚Äì e.g. someone meant to cooperate but accidentally chose &quot;cheat&quot; ‚Äì one error between two Copycat players means they'll take revenge on each other over a single slip-up, forever.</p>
<p>So, in a repeated game with mistakes, the winning strategy is &quot;Copykitten&quot;: cooperate in the first round, then keep cooperating <em>unless the other player cheats *twice in a row*.</em></p>
<p>Copykitten thrives, because it forgives the occasional mistake, but is not <em>so</em> forgiving that it enables a co-dependent relationship with an abuser.</p>
<p>Maybe my voice of conscience could learn a bit from game theory.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>After such a huge success, my voice of conscience prompted me once again to try a <strong>‚≠êÔ∏è MAGNUM OPUS ‚≠êÔ∏è</strong></p>
<p>So, I designed not <em>just</em> a tool for understanding systems, but a tool <em>for designing</em> tools for understanding systems! This would change the world by blah blah blah it was a mess in concept and execution and I should've killed this darling earlier.</p>
<p>I also dated another person with mental disorders for the purpose of &quot;saving them.&quot; This was <em>still</em> a terrible idea.</p>
<p>But aside from that, the &quot;Nicky is Non-Binary&quot; sub-plot was going well! I bought femme clothes, wore makeup and nail polish in public more often, and tried feminizing my voice.</p>
<p>I also found a cool hack for getting nice tits and ass without hormones: weightlifting workouts targeting the chest and glutes.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/2017-1.jpg" alt="2017-1"></p>
<p><em>(Nicky Case, 2017, who had a nice ass)</em></p>
<h2>2018: The Year of Dreaming Small</h2>
<p>On New Year's Day 2018 ‚Äì during a cramped five-hour car ride ‚Äì I had a deep personal conversation with a close friend of mine. He helped me realize:</p>
<ul>
<li>My obsession with sacrificing myself for strangers</li>
<li>My obsession with making a big <strong>‚≠êÔ∏è MAGNUM OPUS ‚≠êÔ∏è</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Were the same thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>My maladaptive belief that I had to &quot;do the big heroic thing&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's our cultural ethos ‚Äì Dream Big, set ambitious goals, shoot for the moon if you miss you'll land among the stars...</p>
<p>I finally realized it's <em>all</em> bullshit.</p>
<p>I already knew it was BS in game development ‚Äì every beginner gamedev tries to make an open-world MMORPG as their first project, coz &quot;Dream Big&quot;. That's why gamedev schools say it over and over: <em>Scope Small, iterate quickly, prototype early and often.</em> Or:</p>
<p><strong>Evolution &gt; Revolution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lots of tiny steps &gt; The big sexy thing.</strong></p>
<p>And in my professional life, the small experimental projects were usually more meaningful <em>and</em> popular than my attempted Magnum Opi.</p>
<p>But my friend helped me realize I made the same mistake in my <em>personal</em> life ‚Äì trying to change myself in big revolutionary acts.</p>
<p>I want to be more considerate? <em>Let's bleed into a sink instead of bothering anyone!</em> I want to help people? <em>Let's be this stranger's one-person suicide hotline for six months!</em> I want to be more forgiving? <em>Let's live with a serial kid-fucker!</em></p>
<p>So, in 2018, I opted for evolution &gt; revolution.</p>
<p>Small daily habits &gt; big sexy goals.</p>
<p>My New Year's Resolution for 2018 was to &quot;try making one new habit a month&quot;. Without repeating <a href="/habits-i-tried-to-make-in-2018/">my blog post about it</a>, here's the habits that I still have, that helped me the most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meditating 10 minutes a day</li>
<li>Spaced repetition flashcards (to learn French! Omelette au fromage!)</li>
<li>Voice-feminization training</li>
<li>No porn</li>
<li>Making my bed each morning</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this revolutionized my life. Which <em>was the point.</em> It &quot;merely&quot; improved my life. I felt more focused, more energetic, and ‚Äì though I still had an anxiety disorder ‚Äì my physical+mental health had never been better.</p>
<p>As a sexy child psychologist once told me: I'm okay.</p>
<h2>2019: The Year of Being Okay</h2>
<p>I made two more important habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach out to a friend every day</li>
<li>Meet a friend face-to-face once a week</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These two habits alone boosted my mental health by a heckload.</strong> Friendship is <em>THE</em> problem when you work independently. There's no school or work schedule to automatically make you meet the same people regularly, so it's too easy to just... forget.</p>
<p>I'm lucky I formed this habit of staying in touch with friends. Because in 2019, I finally had to move back to Canada. Under the new US administration, it was a lot harder to get a visa. (along with, um, <em>many</em> other things that got harder)</p>
<p>I'm also lucky I was learning French, because I moved to Montr√©al. Tabarnak de poutine!</p>
<p>I had a one-month depressive episode after moving ‚Äì I felt like I left all my friends behind. But thanks to 1) US friends introducing me to Montr√©al friends, and 2) Regularly scheduled videocalls with US friends, my psychological need for belonging was fulfilled!</p>
<p>Friends: I love you. You <em>are</em> my family. üíñ</p>
<p>Before &amp; during &amp; after my move, I made <strong><a href="https://ncase.me/anxiety/">Adventures With Anxiety</a></strong>, an interactive story about anxiety... where you play <em>as</em> the anxiety.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/awa1.png" alt="awa1"></p>
<p>I knew I <em>didn't</em> want to do a Magnum Opus to &quot;make the world a better place&quot;, or even to &quot;help others&quot;! I wanted to do this project for a reason that, in years past, I rejected as the sick philosophy of a narcissistic asshole:</p>
<p><strong>I did it for <em>myself</em>.</strong></p>
<p>When I asked my educator/researcher friends how they do things for the world, they replied: <em><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/fearsonas-whats-30613011">they don't</a></em>. They do what's valuable for <em>themselves</em>, which has the sustainable side-effect of doing work that's valuable for others.</p>
<p>(And because you're doing it &quot;for yourself&quot; and not &quot;for the world&quot;, you have the incentive &amp; know-how to make it <em>actually</em> valuable, not on-paper &quot;valuable&quot; like my BS startup or Magnum Opi)</p>
<p>So, I made <em>Adventures With Anxiety</em> because it'd help <em>me</em> ‚Äì with the side-effect of helping my friends, and the 1 in 27 people worldwide with an anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>At first, I planned to make the anxiety-wolf character just a total jerk. However, Proper Storytelling Technique dictates that all characters should have clear relatable motivations.</p>
<p>Huh. That was an interesting question: what <em>is</em> anxiety's motivation? I asked my anxiety about it. I listened. It said:</p>
<p><em>I want you to be a good person.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, so you've told me a zillion times. What else?</p>
<p><em>I want you to be safe.</em></p>
<p>That... made a lot of sense. The evolutionary function of the fight/flight response <em>is</em> to keep an organism safe. <strong>Anxiety, who I always thought was a Big Bad Wolf, is actually trying to be a guard dog.</strong> What else?</p>
<p><em>I want you to be loved.</em></p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>My memory scrolled up 6000 words to the Year 2010 section, where I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I want to not be lonely ‚Üí I must become a good person&quot;</p>

<p>Are you <em>kidding</em> me. <em>Ten years</em> of throwing myself into big Magnum Opus projects, of hurting my physical &amp; mental health for strangers, of trying to find &quot;meaning in my life&quot;... was all just because I was <em>lonely?!</em></p>
<p>But of course. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/302/5643/290.abstract">Social pain is neurologically similar to physical pain</a>, because humans have no natural defenses, and thus evolved to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7777651">need to belong</a> to a tribe who'll keep them safe. That's why people join cults &amp; hate-groups ‚Äì you sell an outcast a tribe that says <em>you're better than all those fuckers who rejected you</em>, why, you got yourself a sale.</p>
<p>So I listened to my anxiety, and made this the wolf's motivation:</p>
<p><strong>Anxiety wants to guard your fundamental human needs.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/awa2-1.png" alt="awa2-1"></p>
<p>The rest of my decade inspired the rest of this game.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, the human tries to drown out their wolf with something horrible. This was inspired by me numbing myself with risky sex in 2012.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, the human is about to <em>do</em> something horrible, and the wolf must save the day. This was inspired by my almost killing a dude in 2016.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4 (the final chapter), the human and wolf do something utterly shocking... they sit down, chat, and listen to each other.</p>
<p>This was inspired by ‚Äì strange loop ‚Äì me trying to write this game in 2019.</p>
<p>Just like how writing <em>Coming Out Simulator</em> helped me make sense of my past, writing <em>Adventures With Anxiety</em> helped me have a <em>much</em> healthier relationship with my emotions. In fact, after 10+ years, I...</p>
<p>Hang on, let me find some wood to knock.</p>
<p>(knock knock)</p>
<p>...I don't think I have an anxiety disorder anymore.</p>
<p>I think my anxiety is very well-ordered now, thank you very much. It shows up to meetings, offers valuable constructive criticism, but is open to discussion with my other emotions.</p>
<p>I'm serious. For example, my most recent bout of rumination: I was struggling to decide if I should share my violent-urge stories in this post. After consulting with close friends, I brought my emotions together for a board meeting.</p>
<p>My &quot;negative emotions&quot; listed some pros &amp; cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro: If we <em>don't</em> share our story, we're being inauthentic.</li>
<li>Con: There's a chance of getting ostracized over this.</li>
</ul>
<p>My &quot;positive emotions&quot; also listed some pros &amp; cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro: We gotta share ALL the stories! We're an <em>ARTISTE</em></li>
<li>Con: Oh girl, wouldn't it be <em>cool</em> to take a secret to the grave? That's <em>sexy.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>(So many self-help books ask you to challenge your negative self-talk, but not your positive self-talk. Spoiler alert, that's how you become a narcissistic asshole.)</p>
<p>I trusted my emotions, <em>but verified them with reason</em>. Working with my emotions as (imperfect) advisors, I decided to share my story, taking care to minimize the risks that my fear helped me notice.</p>
<p>Thanks, anxiety. This time I mean it.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/awa3.png" alt="awa3"></p>
<p>Adventures With Anxiety reached 2 million people. I'll always cherish the fan-emails I got, saying it helped them deeper than therapy ever had. üíñ Some fans even drew their own anxieties as animals, i.e. <a href="https://twitter.com/ncasenmare/status/1175174021513732096">&quot;fearsonas&quot;</a>!</p>
<p>In line with my new philosophy of &quot;do things for myself (that happen to help others)&quot;, my next project ‚Äì launches February 2020? ‚Äì will be a free, online tool for trans/non-binary folks to train their voice.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/voice.png" alt="voice"></p>
<p>We'll see how it goes, along with the rest of the new decade. Then I'll publicly own up to my new mistakes, dissect them in a long blog post, and share what I learn.</p>
<p>Here's queer cheers to 10 more years. üéâ</p>

<h2>Epilogue: Proper Storytelling Technique</h2>
<p>Everything I said was fiction.</p>
<p>Not a <em>lie</em> ‚Äì but fiction, the same way the physics idea of &quot;point mass in a frictionless vacuum&quot; is fiction. A simplified model.</p>
<p>There were 3,652 days in this decade. If each day were a data point...</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/map0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>...then my story was merely the <em>curve of best fit:</em></p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2019/12/map1-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Stories are like maps ‚Äì they're helpful not <em>despite</em> being simplified, but <em>because</em> they're simplified. <em>‚ÄúThe map is not the territory, but you can't fold up the territory and put it in your pocket.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Call it post-post-modernism. (or, &quot;pragmatism&quot;) Sure, every narrative is made up ‚Äì the same way every map is made up ‚Äì yet some maps give better guidance than others.</p>
<p>So now that I've mapped out my last 10 years, what guidance does it give me for my next 10 years? Or:</p>
<h2>No Seriously, What Did I Learn This Decade?</h2>
<p>Here's my current Life Map, drawn in pencil, subject to change:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's okay to ask for help.</li>
<li>Violent intrusive thoughts are common, and don't mean you'll act on them.</li>
<li>&quot;Your feelings are always valid&quot; and &quot;Negative emotions are irrational&quot; are both harmful bullshit.</li>
<li>Emotions are (imperfect) advisors: Trust, but verify.</li>
<li>Forgive the occasional moral mistake, but don't be so forgiving you enable abusers. (It's game theory!)</li>
<li>Evolution &gt; Revolution</li>
<li>Small daily habits &gt; Big heroic acts</li>
<li>Do things for yourself, that <em>happen</em> to help others. (or at least not hurt others)</li>
<li>Anxiety is a guard dog for my fundamental human needs: for survival, growth, and love.</li>
</ol>
<p>And some stuff to figure out in 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>How to balance time working &amp; time with friends?</strong> Experiment: try cowork-dates with pals?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How to balance &quot;explore&quot; and &quot;exploit&quot;?</strong> I like doing wildly differect projects, but I feel bad there's no &quot;unifying purpose&quot;. And when I <em>do</em> focus on one project, I feel boxed in. Experiments: Have <em>multiple</em> unifying purposes? Take one day off per week for &quot;pure exploration&quot;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How to balance being authentic &amp; not getting &quot;cancelled&quot;?</strong> And I can't just &quot;not care about strangers on the internet&quot; since my food &amp; rent is paid for by strangers on the internet. Experiments: Share more personal stories? Offer constructive criticism about toxicity in the social justice movement? Reveal that I've secretly been a furry for 15 years and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210121133104/https://ncase.me/catgirls.png">here's my two catgirl fursonas</a>?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel disappointed-yet-relieved that these questions are kind of <em>boring</em> compared to &quot;how do I deal with intrusive thoughts of cutting off my own fingers?&quot; I guess I'll need to find new sources of growth &amp; excitement outside myself.</p>
<p>Why not? It's 2020, a new decade, a new start. I'm 25 years old and I know everything.</p>
<p>What's the worst that could happen?</p>
