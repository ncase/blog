Hello, y'all classy blog/rss feed readers! I got something new for you today ‚Äî my first vlog!

Okay this isn't actually my *first* first vlog, but it's my first in over 10 years? I want to experiment more with video ‚Äî (more fun for me & you, makes it easier to showcase simulations & animated explainers, larger audience reach, Video Killed The Everything Else Star) ‚Äî so, here's a vlog, where I am a cartoon cat showing you what I've been up to the last month.

‚è±Ô∏è 10 min vlog ‚§µ ([direct link](https://youtu.be/JOj97Edna7k))

Enjoy! I also hope that with this commitment to "one vlog a month", I'll finally be out of my years-long rut, and be shipping & creating more regularly again.

P.S: Thank you to my friend T.R. for motivating me to finish this, by taking $50 from me and threatening to burn it if I didn't upload it before Aug 31st midnight. Not exactly a scaleable solution to ADHD but it worked this time I guess
