Oh! To compete!    
With an autocomplete!    
In a recent RCT[^1]    
They found that good ol' GPT    
Could beat!    
A human like me.    

Oh! Dare I ask!    
At what special human task!    
Poetry, and humans guessed    
worse than chance, at the test    
of who's human, and confessed    
to like AI above the rest:    
Obsolete!    
A human like me.    

Oh! What a shame!    
Who's the scapegoat I shall blame!    
The masses, their dumb asses?     
Postmodern poets who don't rhyme?    
The study, it's too cruddy?    
Sam Altman tryna make a dime?    

`Or, let's go back in time?`

Copernicus! You *did* frick us!    
WE ARE NOT THE CENTER.    
Darwin-Wallace! *Apes*, you call us?!    
WE ARE NOT THE CENTER.    
Turing-Gödel! Turning hurdles!    
Understanding is compression.[^2]    
Intelligence is search.[^3]    
Existential-o depression    
from each scientific lurch.    

WE ARE NOT THE CENTER.    
THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT BEING:    

A human like me.

.

.

.

O... kay....?

Pretty erudite, for a Luddite    
I was playing. Science is a'ight, a'ight?    
I like not dying of cholera or smallpox    
or burying half our kids in a small box    
(as they did before germ theory[^4])    
It's erm, eerie,    
how the past wasn't health-compliant.    
I'd have to be an ungrateful brat    
to piss on the shoulders of giants.    

And yet, the ape-part of me    
the part that lives on a Disc World    
under a dome speckled with Gods,    
the part that hates poetry that doesn't rhyme,    
the part that lives    
*in the center*

That part cries out!    
It's got to shout!

> Oh! Myth is dead.    
> It's ok to feel bereft.    
> Oh! The ineffable!	    
> *It's been fully eff'd!*    

Once there was a time when Art was the pinnacle    
of human glory. Then a billion dollars and a nickel    
later, a next-token-predictor can write poetry the fickle    
humans prefer over human poetry. It tickles    
my ironic nerves that we now take superior pride in,    
what,    
Counting the R's in "strawberry"?    
Playing a pixel puzzle game?[^5]    
Drawing hands that aren't scary?    
*That's* our claim to fame?

(bish, *i* can't draw hands either 😭)

And sure, this current boom may fail    
We've hit diminishing returns on scale[^6]    
Backprop, big data and a VC whale    
May not be enough this time.

`Or, let's go forth in time?`

Not enough *this* time.

But it's *only* a matter of time.

We will not be the center.

We never were.

And that's fine.

They raised us to love being special    
(then complain that "narcissism" is up[^7])    
But growing up means realizing it's okay    
to not be special    
to not be the center of Attention and/or Creation    
to not have poetry that scans good    
Fuck it, I'm having fun    
Once we automate it all away    
And there's nothing we *need* to do    
And there's nothing we *need* from each other    
We'll be forced to answer,    
scared    
sacred    
What do we *want* to do?    
What do we *want* to be for each other?

*Whose center*    
do you want to be?

"A human likes *me?"*

.

.

.

Wait, was *that* my so-called wisdom?    
A saccharine cliché?    
"The real fully-automated space communism    
was all the friends we made along the way"?    
What about AI existential risk?    
What was that about the world being a disk?    
What about AI being used to rope ya    
into a totalitarian dystopia    
and oop, yeah    
well    
Were you expecting anything actually useful from a poem?    
Art? Being *useful?* lol    
This is why humans prefer AI poetry    
Shit, I can't even have an uplifting moment    
Without undercutting it with ironic cynicism    
(Hey! Maybe that's what'll stop rogue AI)    
(By being trained on internet data)    
(If it becomes self-aware it'll just get depressed)

Fuck it, I'm having fun

Let's end this with a _true_ human poem, that I *know* a corporate chatbot will never make: a poem, of copyrighted characters and sexual content.

Behold, Art:

> There once was a mouse named Mickey    
> Who whipped out his mousey dickey    
> And started humping    
> Mr. Xi Jinping    
> While reading the Tiananmen Square Wiki
> 
> (don't worry, it's consensual)

Oh! What a purge!    
Of many a mental urge!    
And my ape, who wants to sing the mythical    
And my brain, who wants to eff the ineffable    
And my heart, who's torn about being ethical    
And the machine, maybe at the pinnacle    
We'll all merge?...

A human-like me.

[^1]: Well, "recent". From [a 2024 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-76900-1): "participants performed below chance levels in identifying AI-generated poems \[and\] were more likely to judge AI-generated poems as human-authored than actual human-authored poems." The human poets ranged from Shakespeare to Whitman to Plath. The AI poet was ChatGPT _3.5_, with no prompt engineering, or feedback & iteration.

[^2]: **"Understanding is Compression"** is an idea that's been around for centuries, if not exactly in those words. Ockham's Razor says that given two theories that explain the same thing, we should pick the simpler one. Einstein said _"A theory is more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises, the more different things it relates, and the more expanded its area of application.”_

	And now, this idea is finding good use in AI! Neural networks trained with regularization (rewarding simplicity), and Auto-encoders (compress large input → small embedding → decompress back to original input), both lead to AI that's more robust & generalizes better.
    
    Hat tip to these papers: [Understanding as Compression](https://spaces-cdn.owlstown.com/blobs/4pab25rnepck8d3lp5lq2jk5ynx7) by Daniel A. Wilkenfeld, a delightful accessable read. [Information compression, intelligence, computing, and mathematics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.8599) by J Gerard Wolff, founder of the SP (Simplicity-Power) Theory of Intelligence. [Understanding is Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07723) by Li, Huang, Wang, Hu, Wyeth, Bu, Yu, Gao, Liu & Li, which show that LLMs can compress text (and even images/audio) _better_ than standard compression algorithms!

[^3]: **"Problem-solving is (heuristic) search"** is also an old idea:

    Turing & Champernowne designed [the first chess AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turochamp) in 1948, which searched every possible move & counter-move, then selected the best move, based on a "heuristic" (rule-of-thumb) based on the value of pieces, safety & mobility of the pieces, etc.
    
    Simon & Newell created the [General Problem Solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Problem_Solver) in 1957, which could take _any_ formal game/system, like mazes or Sudokus or geometry, and search through possible moves ("operators") to get to the solution. Because of the exponential explosion in possible states, their AI tried to narrow down its search using a means-ends heuristic: first try moves that _directly_ get you closer to your goal, backtrack only when that fails.
    
    Skipping decades ahead, DeepMind released [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero) in 2017, which beat human grandmasters at chess, go, and shogi ("Japanese Chess"). The core of AlphaZero is the Monte Carlo Tree Search, which, once again, is "just" search through possible moves & counter-moves. But this time, instead of being hard-coded like in past chess AIs, the heuristic is a neural network that's learnt from scratch!

[^4]: For _thousands_ of years, across _all_ human cultures: [the percent of kids who died before age 15 was around 50%](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality#key-insights). This only changed around ~1850, when the work of Jon Snow & Louis Pasteur (& many others) proved that diseases spread through "germs" that were invisible to the naked eye. Only after this scientific discovery, public health infrastructure _actually worked_. Global child mortality plummeted from 50% then to "only" 4% now, and "only" 0.3% in the best countries. To quote a wise philosopher: ["YEAH SCIENCE, BITCH!"](https://youtu.be/l4bW99gtXR8?si=HBuGgQPQPSKxltjD&t=187)

[^5]: The [Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus (ARC)](https://arcprize.org/) is one of the few famous tests for AI that is (currently) unbeaten. You know [those IQ tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices#Problem_structure) where you look at some shapes, figure out the pattern, then select the shape that continues the pattern? ARC is like those, but 1) in pixel-game format, and 2) designed to be "easy for Humans, hard for AI".

	The reason they're hard for current AI is because — unlike AI excelling at math word problems or reciting facts from textbooks — there _is no common pattern_ in the ARC puzzles, and _no way to memorize the answers_, because the non-profit behind ARC uses a private test that's never been put online. ([but they have a public version humans can play with, and AIs can train with](https://arcprize.org/play).)

[^6]: Toby Ord, co-founder of Giving What We Can and author of _The Precipice_ — a book on existential risk that gave AI the highest probability of all things that could cause human extinction this century — more recently, Ord is collecting stats that show, contrary to AI bulls, modern LLM improvements are coming at unsustainably exponential costs:

    [Inference Scaling and the Log-x Chart](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/inference-scaling-and-the-log-x-chart) shows how AI companies lie with statistics by making their _x_ axis exponential, and _not_ the y axis.
    
    [Are the Costs of AI Agents Also Rising Exponentially?](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/hourly-costs-for-ai-agents) shows that, unlike humans — whose performance is linear: we can do 10× as much work in 10× as much time — LLM agents hit diminishing returns _fast_.

[^7]: While factchecking my poem, I found a 2024 meta-analysis that showed young people's "narcissism" has actually been _declining_ since 2008, possibly due to the financial crisis! [See Figure 5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jopy.12982). I guess the misperception that "narcissism is rising" is due to narcissistic traits being _more visible & rewarded_ in a modern attention economy, not due to actual generational changes.

    Also, reminder that:
    
    1\) [The "narcissism scale" is a flawed measure](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jopy.12982) that mixes up healthy & unhealthy traits,
    
    2\) Don't confuse "younger people score higher on narcissism" (age effect) with "each generation is getting more narcissistic" (cohort effect). [That's a fallacy](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/25152459251342750), like confusing "younger people are shorter in height" and "each generation is getting shorter in height".
    
    3\) People with [narcissistic personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder) aren't cartoon villains, they're actual people.
