_(content note: scientific discussion of depression & suicide)_

**Summary:** Exactly what it says in the title.

The "standardised effect size" of antidepressants on depression, vs placebo, is around 0.4. (This is like going from an average **C to a C+**.)

In contrast, the effect size of 1700mg/day of "≥60% EPA" Omega-3 is _over twice that_, at around 1.0. (This is like going from a **C to a B**.)

Better yet, the effect size of 5000mg/day of Vitamin D is around 1.8! (This is like going from a **C to an A–**.) It works even for people who _don't_ have a Vitamin D insufficiency — which almost half of American adults _do_.

Even if you're already taking Vitamin D & Omega-3, you may _still_ not be taking enough. The "official" recommendations _are all 3 to 10 times too low_. Both these supplements are safe, cheap, and over-the-counter, with _positive_ side-effects (on Covid & cognition) — yet they can save your mental health, maybe even your life. Please take them!

## A crash course in "effect sizes"

In Alicetown, the average person has 4 younger cousins.    
In Bobtown, the average person has 3 younger cousins.

Alright, not so surprising. You may not even notice a difference.

In Alicetown, the average person has 4 limbs.    
In Bobtown, the average person has 3 limbs.

You'd *definitely* notice.

It's the same absolute difference (4 vs 3) _and_ relative difference (3/4). So what makes limbs more surprising than cousins? Well, partly it's more dramatic & visible, but also because: _we expect high variation in the number of someone's younger cousins, but not their number of limbs_.

This is why scientists calculate an **"effect size"** or **"standardised mean difference"** ("mean" = average). We take the difference between two groups, then divide by the total amount of variation, _to account for how surprising a difference is_.

(This is a health article, not a math article, so I'll skip the formulas in this post. If you're curious, [: check out this 4 min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTgouKMz-eI).)

Unfortunately for laypeople, the effect size is usually just reported as a number, like "+0.74" for [spacing out your studying vs cramming](http://www.lscp.net/persons/ramus/docs/EPR20.pdf), or "–0.776" for [sleep deprivation on attention](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20438143/).

But what's that _mean?_ How can we make these numbers _intuitive?_

Well, a common way for data to be is [a bell-shaped curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) (it's so normal it's literally just called a "normal" curve). And most of us are, alas, well-acquainted with the bell curve in school grades. ("grading on a curve")

// PICTODO: bell curves, like height, grades etc

So: school grades give us a useful way to think about standardised effect sizes! We can now convert that number _into an actual letter grade:_

- **F:** -2.0 below average
- **D:** -1.0 below average
- **C:** average
- **B:** +1.0 above average
- **A:** +2.0 above average

(the units are in "standard deviations", or "sigmas". what's sigma? ~~sigma ba--~~ just a unit of "how far away this is from average, relative to the total variation".)

// PICTODO bell curve with grades & %

For example: spacing out your studying, relative to cramming, will on average _lift_ your test scores from a C to a B–. (effect size = +0.74) And short-term sleep deprivation, relative to healthy sleep, will on average _tank_ your ability to pay attention from a C to a D+. (effect size: –0.776)

(Note — when reading about effect sizes, always remember: _effect of what, on what, at what dose, for which group, relative to what?_ See the Data Colada post, [Meaningless Means](https://datacolada.org/104).)

(Note 2 — the standard way of "intuitively" describing effect sizes is Cohen's recommendations: 0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large. Personally, I prefer the "school grade letter" comparison, since it's more concrete. But hey, you do you.)

But it's not limited to just grades & academic performance — effect sizes can help us understand any kind of difference between groups, in observation or in experiments!

For example...

## Depression!

Let's use our school grade analogy, to interpret effect sizes on mental health:

**What's an "F in mental health"?** By definition of a bell curve, ~2.3% of people are below –2 sigma (an "F"). (See: [this bell curve calculator](https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/normal.html).) [In Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/suicide-canada-key-statistics-infographic.html), ~2.6% of people had suicidal ideation in 2022, while [in the US](https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2024/us-national-trends-and-disparities-in-suicidal-ideation-suicide-attempts-and-health-care-use), it was ~4.9% in 2019. So, it's not too far off to say: "F in mental health = literally suicidal". (Also, reminder that ~4% is 1-in-25 people. You likely know someone, or _are_ someone, who will feel suicidal this year. Please reach out to your friends & loved ones!)

**What's a "D in mental health"?** ~16% of people are below –1 sigma (a "D") on a bell curve. [The Keyes 2002 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12096700/) estimated that ~14.1% of adults meet the DSM-III criteria for a major depressive episode. So, D = Depressed.

**What's an average "C in mental health"?** ~68% of people are within a sigma of average (a "C") on a bell curve. Same above study found that 56.6 percent had moderate mental health. They were neither "languishing" nor "flourishing". I guess C = Could Be Worse.

**What's a "B in mental health"?** ~16% of people are _above_ +1 sigma (a "B") on a bell curve. Same above study found that 17.2% of adults are "flourishing". Good for them! B = Flourishing, life is good.

**What's an "A in mental health"?** I don't know who these freaks are. I actually _could not_ find any scientific studies on "the +2 sigma in well-being". In contrast, there's _lots_ of research on suicidal ideation, the –2 sigma in well-being. In the absence of any actual data, I'll just say: A = AWESOME

// PICTODO

- F = suicidal
- D = depressed
- C = s'okay
- B = flourishing
- A = awesome!

So, if an intervention is found to have an effect size of +1.0, that's like going up a letter grade. If something's found to have an effect size of –2.0, that's like going _down_ two letter grades. And so on.

Okay, so how do we get peoples' "mental health grades" up?

Let's look at antidepressants, Omega-3, and Vitamin D, in turn:

---

## Antidepressants

The good news is they work. The bad news is they don't work as well as you'd think they may work.

**[Cipriani et al 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5889788/)** is a recent meta-analysis (a study collecting lots of previous studies) that investigated 21 different antidepressants. In total, they analyze 522 studies with 116,477 participants total. The most effective antidepressant, _Amitriptyline_, relative to placebo, had an Odds Ratio of 2.13  — [which converts to](https://www.escal.site/) a Cohen's d effect size of 0.417 — which is "small-medium" according to Cohen's recommendations. Or, by our school-letter-grade comparison: **the best antidepressant would take your mental health grade from an F to F+, or C to C+.**

From Figure 3 of that paper, you can see that Amitriptyline has the highest estimated effect size, while the side effects are no worse than placebo:

![The effect sizes & dropout rates of various antidepressants, vs placebo.](../content/stuff/2026-01/depression/Figure3.jpg "The effect sizes & dropout rates of various antidepressants, vs placebo.")

Now, "F to F+" _can_ be lifesaving, but… y'know… that's not a lot. And again, this is the effect _on average._ Some people respond much better to antidepressants… while some respond much worse.

## Omega-3

Keep getting confused on which molecule is what? Me too. So, here's a crash course on various fats:

Fatty acids are chains of carbons & hydrogens + two oxygens. They say "OOH" at one end, and "HHH" at the other end:

// TODO PIC

A saturated fatty acid is one where all the carbons' free spots are filled up with hydrogens. (Hence, "saturated") This makes the molecule stick straight out. This is why _long_ saturated fatty acids — like those found in butter — tend to be solid at room temperature.

(Contrary to popular belief, saturated fats don't _literally_ clog your arteries, like grease in plumbing pipes. What happens is _{ha ha I don't actually understand this}_. [Something about your cholesterol levels & inflammation](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/cir.0000000000000510).)

// PIC saturated vs unsaturated, mono poly olive oil & fish

In contrast, _unsaturated_ fatty acids have at least one hydrogen missing. This causes them to have a double-bond "kink" in the molecule. This makes them _not_ stick out, which is why unsaturated fats — like those found in olive oil and fish oil — tend to be liquid at room temperature. _Mono-unsaturated_ fatty acids (MUFAs) only have one kink, _poly-unsaturated_ fatty acids (PUFAs) have two or more kinks. Let's be mature adults about this, please.

// PIC trans fat

For completeness: _trans fats_ are unsaturated fats whose "kink" is twisted around, causing them to go straight. That is the worst sentence I've written all month. The twisted kink is caused by the hydrogens being on opposite sides, hence "trans". (And yes, if they're on the same side it's "cis". Latin was a mistake.) The molecule being straight is why trans fats — which margarine _used_ to be full of  — are solid at room temperature, despite being an unsaturated fat.

_(Hey, what do you call it when you get thiccer on HRT? Trans fat! :D)_

It's neat whenever you can trace the history of something right down to its atoms! Margarine was first invented because it's cheaper, and can spread straight from the fridge, unlike butter. Margarine (used to be) made by taking _unsaturated_ vegetable oils, which were cheaper than animal fats, then pumping a bunch of hydrogens into it (hence, "hydrogenated oils") to turn them into trans fats. In the 1970s & 80s, the FDA concluded that trans fats weren't harmful to humans, and nutritionists _promoted_ margarine over butter full of its unhealthy saturated fats. [But only in the early 1990s](https://www.cspi.org/resource/artificial-trans-fat-timeline), did scientists realize that trans fats were _even worse_ for you than saturated fats.

// PIC omega-3's 6 9, associated with what, -7?

I need to stop going on infodump tangents. Anyway, Omega-3 is any fatty acid with its first kink at the 3rd carbon from the Omega end ("HHH"), though it can have more kinks later down the chain. (And yes, Omega-6 has its first kink at the 6th carbon, and Omega-9 has its first kink at the 9th carbon. There's nothing _physically_ preventing Omega-4 or Omega-5's from existing, but due to some quirk of evolution, Omega-3, -6, and -9 are the ones biological life uses most. As far as I can tell, there's no specific reason they're all multiples of 3. Probably just a coincidence. There _is_ a less common Omega-7.)

// PIC EPA ALA DHA

_Finally_, there's three main types of Omega-3: EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid), DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid), and ALA (Alpha-Linolenic Acid). ALA is mostly found in plants like chia seeds & walnuts, while EPA & DHA mostly come from seafood, though there _are_ algae-based vegan sources.

For bio-mechanical reasons I don't personally understand but I assume someone else does: EPA is the one associated with anti-inflammation, better brain health, _and less depression_... while DHA isn't. (But DHA is still needed for other stuff, like your neurons' cell walls, so don't cut them out completely!)

(Note: I could not find any _experimental_ trials of ALA on depression, though an _observational_ study in Japan ([Kurotani et al 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212826313001085)) finds a correlation between higher ALA and lower depression. But reminder, correlation is not _necessarily_ causation.)

All the above info in a Venn (technically [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram)) diagram:

// TODO pic // + this article

Okay, enough yap. Time for the actual data:

**[Liao et al 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0515-5.pdf)** did a meta-analysis of double-blinded randomized controlled trials, on Omega-3's effect on depression. Analyzed 26 trials with 2,160 participants total. First: they found no evidence of publication bias — that is, no evidence of people _not_ publishing studies because their effects weren't big enough. That's a good sign!

But more importantly, they found that Omega-3 supplements, that are ≥60% EPA, at around 1 gram per day, have an effect size of 1.03(!!!) on depression, versus placebo. **That's over twice the effect of the _best_ antidepressant, like taking your mental health from F to D, or C to B!**

But it's an upside-down-U shaped relationship: "EPA dosage" _above_ 1 gram a day had no detectable effect. Also, Omega-3 supplements that were _pure_ 100% EPA, "only" had an effect size of +0.50, still on par with the best antidepressant. And pure DHA & or mostly-DHA showed _no_ effect on depression. (These conclusions roughly match an earlier meta-analysis, [Sublette et al 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3534764/).)

Converting this to a specific recommendation:

- The best effect at 1 gram of EPA per day
- From Omega-3 supplements that are 60% EPA
- Therefore: you need 1 ÷ 0.6 ~= 1.667 grams = **1667 milligrams per day of 60%-EPA Omega-3 supplements.**

In comparison, [most official health organizations recommend](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3) "250–500 mg _combined_ EPA and DHA each day for healthy adults." _That is over three times too low,_ at least for optimal effects on depression.

Finally, a (small) study _directly_ investigating the link between suicide & Omega-3. [Sublette et al 2006](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.6.1100): “Low \[DHA\] and low Omega-3 proportions \[...\] predicted risk of suicidal behavior among depressed patients over the 2-year period.” Though keep in mind this is a small study, and it's observational not experimental. Also, weird that contrary to the above studies on depression, _DHA_ predicted suicide but _not_ EPA. Not sure what to make of that.

Bonus: Omega-3 may also boost cognition? [Shahinfar et al 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-16129-8.pdf): “Enhancement
of global cognitive abilities was observed with increasing omega-3 dosage up to 1500 mg/day. \[effect size = 1.00, like going from a grade of C to B!\], followed by downward trend at higher doses.”

## Vitamin D

**[Ghaemi et al 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11650176/)** is a meta-analysis on Vitamin D on depression. Analyzed 31 trials with 24,189 participants total. Again, no publication bias detected. (Good!) Below is Figure 1 + Table 2, showing the effect of Vitamin D dosage, vs placebo, on depression. The solid line is the average estimated effect, dashed lines are 95% confidence interval. Note the effect size is negative in this figure, because they're measuring _reduction_ in depressive symptoms:

![The effect size (with uncertainty) of Vitamin D dosage on depressive symptoms.](../content/stuff/2026-01/depression/VitaminD.png "The effect size (with uncertainty) of Vitamin D dosage on depressive symptoms.")

**The upper range of uncertainty is lowest at 5000 IU (International Units) of Vitamin D a day**, with an estimated effect size of 1.82, with 95% uncertainty from 0.98 to 2.66. **An effect size of 1.82 is like taking your mental health from an F to a C–, or a C to an A–!** And even in the most pessimistic case, 0.98, that's _still_ over twice as effective as the top antidepressant.

(The paper also finds that shorter studies tended to find larger effects than longer studies, but looking at their Supplementary Table 4, this seems to be because longer studies used _lower_ average daily doses. For example, one 52-week study only gave participants 400 IU a day.)

This meta-analysis includes trials with participants who _don't_ have Vitamin D deficiency. There's still a good effect of Vitamin D on depression for them, even if smaller! Though, you probably _are_ lacking Vitamin D: [Liu et al 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29644951/) finds that a bit under half of all adults (41.4%) have Vitamin D Insufficiency.

And that's according to [the "official" recommendation](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-dosage), of 400-800 IU a day… which is _is too damn low_. Even the "official" _maximum safe dose_ of Vitamin D, of 4000 IU/day, is too low. [McCullough et al 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30611908/) gave over thousands of patients 5,000 to 10,000 IU/day, for _seven years_, and there were _zero_ cases of serious side effects. This is in line with [Billington et al 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746327/), a 3-year-long double-blinded randomized controlled trial, where they found "the safety profile of vitamin D supplementation is similar for doses of 400, 4000, and 10,000 IU/day." (though "_mild_ hypercalcemia" increased from 3% to 9%.)

And it makes sense that 10,000 IU a day _should_ be safe. Your skin, exposed to the Sun's ultraviolet rays, can synthesize up to (the equivalent of) 10,000 IU a day, before plateauing out. Source is [Reinhold 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522043763), whose abstract concludes: “Because vitamin D is potentially toxic, intake of >25 μg (1000 IU)/d has been avoided even though the weight of evidence shows that the currently accepted \[limit\] of 50 μg (2000 IU)/d is too low by at least 5-fold.” (So why are all the official sources still so paranoid about Vitamin D? Well, unfortunately, official/governmental policy is always a few decades behind the science in _any_ field. See Also: everything about educational policy.)

Speaking of the Sun, why take supplements instead of just getting Vitamin D from Sun exposure? Well, skin cancer. But also: because Sun-Skin D varies greatly depending on the season, your latitude, and your skin type. There's less ultraviolet rays from the Sun in winter/fall, and at latitudes further from the equator. And [the darker your skin is, the less Vitamin D your skin makes for the same amount of Sun exposure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10861575/). As expected from the biophysics of skin, Black Americans have [the highest prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075634/) (82.1%!!), followed by Hispanic adults (62.9%). So, speaking as someone with Southeast Asian skin, who's currently in Canada during winter, even if I stood outside naked for hours, I'd get approximately _zero_ IU/day of Vitamin D from the Sun.

Finally, a meta-analysis _directly_ measuring the effect of Vitamin D on suicide rates. [Yu et al 2025](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12888-025-06613-w.pdf): “Vitamin D in patients with \[suicidal behaviours\] were significantly lower than in controls (standardized mean difference: –0.69, or a 'medium' difference)”. Reminder that this paper _by itself_ only measures correlation, not causation — but combined with the above experimental trials of Vitamin D on depression, I think it's reasonable to guess there's a causal effect.

To recap:

- Almost half of you have a Vitamin D deficiency according to the official recommendation (800 IU/day)
- And the official recommendation is _way_ too low. Even the official _maximum_ safe dose (4000 IU/day) is below the optimal Vitamin D for depression (5000 IU/day) or what your body can produce from the Sun in optimal conditions (10,000 IU/day). Recent randomized controlled trials confirm that 10,000 IU/day is, indeed, mostly safe.
- Your daily reminder than official policy is often decades behind the science.

Bonus: Vitamin D supplementation was found in several randomized controlled trials [to reduce mortality from Covid-19](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39225947/)! It [probably helps guard against influenza](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322010274) too, though the evidence is small & early.

## Conclusion: _All this time, you lacked the Vitamin?_

Scurvy is caused by a lack of Vitamin C. It's a condition that causes your wounds to re-open up & teeth to fall out. Scurvy used to kill _almost half(!)_ of all sailors on major expeditions; it's estimated millions died. It can be cured by eating lemons.

Rickets is mostly caused by a lack of Vitamin D. It's a condition where kids' bones go all soft and deformed. During the Industrial Revolution, up to 80% of kids suffered from it. It can be prevented with cod liver oil.

Goiters is mostly caused by a lack of Iodine. It's a condition where the thyroid gland in your neck swells up painfully, to the size of an apple. During WWI, a _third_ of adult men had goiters. It can be prevented with iodized salt.

![Tumblr meme: 'All this time, you lacked The Vitamin? And yet you persisted?'](../content/stuff/2026-01/depression/The-Vitamin.png "Tumblr meme: 'All this time, you lacked The Vitamin? And yet you persisted?'")

[About 1 in 4 people are expected to have clinical depression sometime in their life](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health). Depression is the \#1 source of the global "burden from disease" in the mental health category, [which itself is the \#6 burden of disease in the world](https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease#how-do-different-diseases-and-disabilities-contribute-towards-the-burden-of-disease), above Alzheimer's, malaria, and sexually transmitted infections.

(But honestly, did you need those stats? This is likely a lived experience for a lot of you reading this.)

The effective altruists are all, ["woah for just $3000 you can prevent a child's death from malaria"](https://www.givewell.org/how-much-does-it-cost-to-save-a-life) — and that's great! save them kids! — but where's the fanfare for the accumulating evidence that, "woah with cheap daily supplements we can save millions from suicide & depressed lives"?

Over and over again throughout history, some horrific thing that caused millions to suffer, turned out to be "yeah you were missing this one molecule lol". To be clear: not everything is gonna be _that_ simple, and not _every or even most_ cases of depression will be cured with a supplement. Also, all the numbers on this page have with large error bars & uncertainty, more research is needed.

But, as of right now, I feel I can at least confidently claim the following:

- Vitamin D and Omega-3 are _at least on par_ with antidepressants, _on average_. (possibly 2x to 4x as good)
- While being cheap and safe, so, what's the harm of trying? (positive "expected value" for this bet)

So:

**MY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU TO DO A.S.A.P:**

- Go a pharmacy, buy the following supplements over-the-counter, in whatever form you like: (I like the easy-to-swallow gel capsules)
- **Vitamin D**
    - 🌱 By default, Vitamin D supplements are derived from… (quick web search)… _the grease in sheep's wool?_ Huh. Also fish liver oil. Anyway, if you're vegan, make sure your bottle specifically says "vegan" or "from lichen/mushrooms". (If you're vegetarian, the sheep's-wool Vitamin D is fine, they don't kill the sheep for it.)
- **Omega-3 _where EPA is ~60% of the Omega-3 total._** For example, my 500mg Omega-3 capsules have 300mg EPA, 200mg DHA.
    - 🌱 By default, Omega-3 supplements come from fish. If you're veg(etari)?an, there _are_ plant-based sources of Omega-3, but look carefully: most vegan Omega-3 supplements provide _more DHA than EPA_, which the above studies suggest fully cancel out the antidepressant effect. _Double check the nutritional label to make sure it's ≥60% EPA._ For example, [this one is 300mg EPA + 200mg DHA](https://www.amazon.ca/Natures-Way-NutraVege-Plant-Based-Vegetarian/dp/B078T4DC2K?th=1). (_not_ an affiliate link)

**Then, every day:**

- **Take ~5000 IU of Vitamin D**
    - or 4,000 IU, if you wanna play by some arbitrary outdated rule. or 10,000 IU, if you like to live on the edge.
    - bonus: may improve immune response to Covid & influenza?
- **Take ~1700 mg of ≥60%-EPA Omega-3**
    - bonus: may improve cognition?
- (Don't quit your existing antidepressants if they're net-positive for you!)
    - also, ask your doctor about _Amitriptyline_, or those other best-effect-size antidepressants.

Can you get these doses of Vitamin D & Omega-3 through whole foods alone, no supplements? Alas, probably not: even if you went Fully Grizzly Bear Diet, and ate 2000 calories of farmed salmon a day, you'd get 2,500 IU/day of Vitamin D at most. If you ate 2000 calories of _wild_ salmon a day, then probably yes, but oh my god that would get expensive. As for Omega-3, eating mostly oily fishes _would_ get you >1000mg of Omega-3, but they'd be _more DHA than EPA_, which the above studies suggest would cancel out the antidepressant effects.

**The effect sizes on depression:**

- The best antidepressant: **+0.417**
    - like your mental health grade going from F to F+, or C to C+
- 1700mg of ≥60%-EPA Omega-3: **+1.03**
    - like your mental health grade going from F to D, or C to B
- 5000 IU of Vitamin D: **+1.82**
    - like your mental health grade going from F to C–, or C to A–

For completeness & comparison, here's the effect size of other things on depression:

- Any [mainstream "bona-fide" psychotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict) (CBT, Psychodynamic, Humanist, Solutions-Focused): **+0.35**, source: [Kamenov et al 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5244449/)
    - like going from C to C+
- Aerobic/Cardio Exercise: **+0.79**, source [Ioannis et al 2018](https://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/54143117/Ioannis_Morres_et_al_Aerobic_exercise_for_adult_patients_Depression_and_Anxiety_2018.pdf)

[^iv-calculate]: The paper reports these effect sizes. Therapy for Insomnia → Sleep = 0.76, and Therapy for Insomnia → Depression = 0.42. Assuming the therapy _for insomnia specifically_ affects depression _only_ through better sleep (Therapy for Insomnia → Sleep → Depression), we can do an "Instrumental Variable" estimate of the effect of Sleep → Depression = 0.42 / 0.76 = 0.55. Note this could be an overestimate if therapy for insomnia _does_ affect depression through ways outside of sleep. But also note this could also be an _under_-estimate, since this study measured "better sleep" not ideal sleep; _ideal_ sleep may have a larger effect.

(And remember, you can _stack_ any of the above interventions, to get an even larger effect!

Again, remember that all the above numbers have error bars. But even if the quantitative details are uncertain, the _qualitative_ picture is still overall strong: there _exist_ high bang-for-buck ways to reduce depression, which are _at least_ on par with drugs & therapy (possibly 2x to 4x better), that aren't common knowledge amongst policymakers & the public. And again, they're dirt cheap with minor-to-no adverse side effects. Moderate chance of a big win, for a known tiny cost. That's a positive "expected value" bet right there.

I got onto this research rabbithole a few months ago while borrowing my housemate's ADHD meds, which I may or may not eventually collect into a "JOYMAXXING" informal meta-meta-analysis. ([: See me yap about it on video as a cartoon cat](https://youtu.be/JOj97Edna7k?si=xAUt3Kp54RyfGX50&t=334).) But for this blog post, I wanted to dive deeper into Omega-3 & Vitamin D, since their effect sizes are so huge, _and_ they're insultingly cheap & easy, compared to therapy or regular cardio.

Stay safe this winter, keep away the seasonal depression. Get your supplements, and reach out to your friends & loved ones!
